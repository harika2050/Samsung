174,"The World Poverty Clock uses publicly available data on income distribution, production, and consumption, provided by various international organizations, most notably the UN, WorldBank, and the International Monetary Fund"
175,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period, often annually"
176,"The OECD defines GDP as ""an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs)"
177,Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy
178,"William Petty came up with a basic concept of GDP to attack landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the Dutch and the English between 1654 and 1676 
[9] Charles Davenant developed the method further in 1695"
179,The history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it
180,"GDP can be determined in three ways, all of which should, in principle, give the same result"
181,"The most direct of the three is the production approach, which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total"
182,This approach mirrors the OECD definition given above
183,Value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory
184,"The sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as ""GDP at factor cost"""
185,"GDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products is ""GDP at producer price"""
186,"For measuring output of domestic product, economic activities "
187,The value of output of all sectors is then added to get the gross value of output at factor cost
188,"The second way of estimating GDP is to use ""the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units"""
189,"If GDP is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (GDI), or GDP (I)"
190,"This method measures GDP by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire - wages for labour, interest for capital, rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship"
191,"The US ""National Income and Expenditure Accounts"" divide incomes into five categories
"
192,These five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost
193,"Two adjustments must be made to get GDP
"
194,"Total income can be subdivided according to various schemes, leading to various formulae for GDP measured by the income approach"
195,"The sum of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of production in society"
196,The third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers' prices
197,Market goods which are produced are purchased by someone
198,"GDP (Y) is the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports "
199,"Here is a description of each GDP component:
"
200,"Note that C, G, and I are expenditures on final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count"
201,"GDP can be contrasted with gross national product (GNP) or, as it is now known, gross national income (GNI)"
202,GDP is product produced within a country's borders; GNI is product produced by enterprises owned by a country's citizens
203,"For example, the GNI of the USA is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of where the firms are located"
204,Gross national income (GNI) equals GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world
205,"In 1991, the United States switched from using GNP to using GDP as its primary measure of production"
206,"The international standard for measuring GDP is contained in the book System of National Accounts (1993), which was prepared by representatives of the International Monetary Fund, European Union, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations and World Bank"
207,SNA93 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts
208,"Within each country GDP is normally measured by a national government statistical agency, as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required (especially information on expenditure and production by governments)"
209,"The raw GDP figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal, historical, or current, GDP"
210,"For example, suppose a country's GDP in 1990 was $100 million and its GDP in 2000 was $300 million"
211,The factor used to convert GDP from current to constant values in this way is called the GDP deflator
212,"Constant-GDP figures allow us to calculate a GDP growth rate, which indicates how much a country's production has increased (or decreased, if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year"
213,Another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth
214,"The level of GDP in countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate, or the purchasing power parity exchange rate"
215,The ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used
216,"There is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in GDP between high and low income (GDP) countries, as compared to the current exchange rate method"
217,"For more information, see Measures of national income and output"
218,GDP per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards
219,"The major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently, widely, and consistently"
220,GDP does not include several factors that influence the standard of living
221,"It can be argued that GDP per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors, capturing them indirectly"
222,"Simon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income, stated in his first report to the US Congress in 1934, in a section titled ""Uses and Abuses of National Income Measurements"":[11]"
223, The valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria
224,All these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare
225,"Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run"
226,"Ever since the development of GDP, multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using GDP as the overarching measure of economic and social progress"
227,Many environmentalists argue that GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment
228,"Although a high or rising level of GDP is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country, a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances"
229,"GDP does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country, because GDP is merely an aggregate measure"
230,GDP does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work
231,"The UK's Natural Capital Committee highlighted the shortcomings of GDP in its advice to the UK Government in 2013, pointing out that GDP ""focuses on flows, not stocks"
232,"It has been suggested that countries that have authoritarian governments, such as the People's Republic of China, and Russia, inflate their GDP figures"
233,"In response to these and other limitations of using GDP, alternative approaches have emerged"
234,Taxes in India are levied by the Central Government and the state governments
235,The authority to levy a tax is derived from the Constitution of India which allocates the power to levy various taxes between the Central and the State
236,India has abolished multiple taxes with passage of time and imposed new ones
