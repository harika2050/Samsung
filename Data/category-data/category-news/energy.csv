"Energy in India describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in India"
 Energy policy of India describes the policies and strategies of India for achieving sustainable energy security to its people
 Electricity sector in India is the main article of electricity in India
 The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy provides data regarding progress in the non-conventional energy sector
" Since 2013, total primary energy consumption in India has been the third highest in the world (see world energy consumption) after China (see energy in China) and the United States (see energy in the United States)"
India is the second top coal consumer in the year 2017 after China
 India ranks third in oil consumption with 221 million tons in 2017 after the United States and China
 India is net energy importer to meet nearly 45% of its total primary energy
 India: Total primary energy use of 753
India was the fourth top coal producer in 2017 with 294
 Nearly 80% of total electricity generated (utility and captive) in India is from coal
 According to Greenpeace the largest coal belt in India is at Jharia
 Before coal mining Jharia had forests inhabited by tribes
 In 1971 the coal mines were nationalised
 Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) took over Jharia coal mines
 India accounts for the world’s greatest concentration of coal seam fires
" Mine area suffers from pollution of air, water and land"
 India was the third top crude oil consumer globally 
 India is also the top third globally the net crude oil (including crude oil products) importer of 188 Mt in 2017
52 million tons Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) was consumed during April to September 2018 (six months) in domestic sector mainly for cooking
" The number of domestic connections are 247 million (one connection for five people) with a circulation of more than 368 million LPG cylinders whose net aggregate length would form a 150,000 km long pipe line which is more than the length of total railway track laid in India"
 India is second largest consumer of LPG globally
 Most of the LPG requirement is imported
 Piped city gas supply in India is not yet developed on major scale
 Biomass is a renewable energy source and its use for energy generation is carbon-neutral fuel
 It is carbon neutral because it would also release global warming green house gasses like methane and carbon dioxide when it is left to degenerate without using as energy source
" Presently, only 20% of house holds in India use biomass and charcoal for cooking purpose as LPG use for cooking purpose is rising rapidly"
" In addition biomass is also used marginally in commercial cooking, electricity generation, process industries, etc"
 The total biomass use in India is nearly 177 Mtoe in the year 2013
 Substantial surplus crop residue is also burnt in agriculture fields for clearing the land for the next crop
 Nearly 750 million tons of non edible (by cattle) biomass is available annually in India which can be put to use for higher value addition
 Huge quantity of imported coal is being used in pulverised coal-fired power stations
 Raw biomass is not suitable for use in the pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to caking problem
 However 100% biomass can be fired after Torrefaction in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal
 Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source
 Cofiring dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem
 North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems
" As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by LPG at faster pace, biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution"
" Biogas which is mainly methane/natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle, poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print"
 The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil from algae particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future
 Union government is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential
"India was the third largest electricity producer in the world 1272 TWh in FY 2014–15, though only about 80% of the population had access to mains power"
" By 2013, India became the world's third largest producer of electricity with 4"
"8% global share, surpassing Japan and Russia"
India ranks 7th globally in hydropower generation during the year 2015
 India has 111 gigawatts (GW) (32%) installed capacity of renewable energy
 It is one of the world leaders in renewable energy investments and installations
 India has set a set a target of 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022
" This would include 100 GW capacity from solar energy sources, 60 GW from wind power, 10 GW from biopower, and 5 GW from small hydropower"
 A bidding process for a further 115 GW (excluding large hydropower) is expected by the end of FY 2019-20 to achieve 175 GW total installed capacity and in early 2018 the central government set up a US$350-million fund to finance solar projects
 India is the 7th largest producer of hydroelectric power in the world
" As of 30 April 2017, India's installed utility-scale hydroelectric capacity was 44,594 MW, or 13"
5% of its total utility power generation capacity
" Additional smaller hydroelectric power units with a total capacity of 4,380 MW (1"
3% of its total utility power generation capacity) have been installed
" India's hydroelectric power potential is estimated at 148,700 MW at 60% load factor"
" In the fiscal year 2016-17, the total hydroelectric power generated in India was 122"
31 TWh (excluding small hydro) with an average capacity factor of 33%
" The hydro-electric power plants at Darjeeling and Shivanasamudram were established in 1898 and 1902, respectively"
 They were among the first in Asia and India has been a dominant player in global hydroelectric power development
 India also imports surplus hydroelectric power from Bhutan
"Small hydropower, defined to be generated at facilities with nameplate capacities up to 25 MW, comes under the ambit of the Ministry of New and Renewable energy (MNRE); whilst large hydro, defined as above 25 MW, comes under the ambit of Ministry of Power"
" ndia's economically exploitable and viable hydroelectric potential is estimated to be 148,701 MW"
" An additional 6,780 MW from smaller hydro schemes (with capacities of less than 25 MW) is estimated as exploitable"
" 56 sites for pumped storage schemes with an aggregate installed capacity of 94,000 MW have also been identified"
" In central India, the hydroelectric power potential from the Godavari, Mahanadi, Nagavali, Vamsadhara and Narmada river basins has not been developed on a major scale due to potential opposition from the tribal population"
The public sector accounts for 92
5% of India's hydroelectric power production
" The National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), Northeast Electric Power Company (NEEPCO), Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVNL), THDC, and NTPC-Hydro are some of the public sector companies producing hydroelectric power in India"
 The private sector is also expected to grow with the development of hydroelectric energy in the Himalayan mountain ranges and in the northeast of India
" Indian companies have also constructed hydropower projects in Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, and other countries"
"Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), a state-owned enterprise in north India, has an installed capacity of 2"
 BBMB is a major source of peaking power and black start capability to the northern grid in India and its large reservoirs provide wide operational flexibility
 BBMB reservoirs also supply water for the irrigation of 12
"5 million acres (51,000 km2; 19,500 sq mi) of agricultural land in partner states, enabling the green revolution in the northern India"
"The International Hydropower Association estimates that the total hydropower potential in India is 660,000 TWh/year, of which 540,000 TWh/year (79%) is still undeveloped"
" India ranks as the fourth country in the world by undeveloped hydropower potential, after Russia, China and Canada, and fifth by total potential, surpassed also by Brazil"
 India has transformed from an electricity deficit state to an electricity surplus state
 Peak load shortages can be met making use of pumped storage schemes which store surplus power to meet peak load demands
" The pumped storage schemes also contribute secondary, seasonal power at no additional cost when rivers are flooded with excess water"
" India has already established nearly 4,800 MW pumped storage capacity with the installation of hydropower plants"
" Pumped storage units can also be used as pumping stations to supply river water for upland irrigation, industrial needs, and drinking water"
" In a tropical country like India, abundant watefor agriculture is needed due to a very high annual evaporation rate"
 The amount of water necessary to meet this demand can be harnessed from India's rivers via pumped storage units
 Food security in India is improved with water security which in turn is possible from the energy security to supply the power needed for the pumped storage schemes
More and more solar power generation is becoming available at cheaper cost and it has advantage in terms of environmental impact
 Solar power can meet daytime and night time energy demands with the help of pumped storage units
" Many of the existing hydro power stations on the west-flowing rivers located in the Western Ghats of Kerala and Karnataka are to be expanded to include pumped storage units in an effort to solve the water deficit of east-flowing rivers like the Kaveri, the Krishna, etc"
 Wind power generation capacity in India has significantly increased in recent years
 As of 31 March 2019 the total installed wind power capacity was 36
"625 GW, the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world"
" Wind power capacity is mainly spread across the South, West, North and East regions"
 Wind power costs in India are decreasing rapidly
 The levelised tariff of wind power reached a record low of 243
" In December 2017, union government announced the applicable guidelines for tariff-based wind power auctions to bring more clarity and minimise the risk to the developers"
" Development of wind power in India began in December 1952, when Maneklal Sankalchand Thacker, a distinguished power engineer, initiated a project with the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to explore the possibilities of harnessing wind power in the country"
 The CSIR established a Wind Power Sub-Committee under P
" Nilakantan, which was assigned the task of investigating the available resources that could be practically utilized, along with researching the economic possibilities of wind energy"
" With assistance from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Sub-Committee extensively reviewed available data on surface winds in India and their velocity duration, and began detailed surveys of promising sites for harnessing the optimum amount of wind energy; it also successfully developed and tested large wood-and-bamboo windmills"
 Golding's recommendations were adopted by the CSIR in 1957
" By this time, regions of Saurashtra and around Coimbatore had been identified as promising sites for generating electricity from wind power, and the Wind Power Sub-Committee had begun to erect 20 wind velocity survey stations across India, in addition to testing its indigenously designed windmills and obtaining a 6 kw"
" Allgaier wind turbine, which was presented to India by the West German government; experiments at Porbandar with the latter had commenced by 1961"
" The Indian government also considered a proposal to erect over 20,000 small to medium-sized wind-powered electrical generators in rural districts, to be used for powering water pumps and supplying electricity for remotely situated structures such as lighthouses"
" In 1960, the CSIR established a Wind Power Division as part of the new National Aeronautical Laboratory (NAL) in Bangalore, which was founded that year"
" From the 1960s into the 1980s, the NAL and other groups continued to carry out wind velocity surveys and develop improved estimates of India's wind energy capacity"
" Large-scale development of wind power began in 1985 with the first wind project in Veraval, Gujarat, in the form of a 40-kW Dutch machine (make Polenko) connected to the grid"
" In 1986, demonstration wind farms were set up in the coastal areas of Maharashtra (Ratnagiri), Gujarat (Okha) and Tamil Nadu (Tirunelveli) with 55 kW Vestas wind turbines"
 These demonstration projects were supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)
" Jami Hossain of TERI University, New Delhi"
" This was subsequently re-validated by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, US (LBNL) in an independent study in 2012"
" As a result, the MNRE set up a committee to reassess the potential and through the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE, previously C-WET) has announced a revised estimation of the potential wind resource in India from 49,130 MW to 302,000 MW assessed at 100 m hub height"
 Wind turbines are now being set up at even 120 m hub height and the wind resource at higher hub heights of around 120 m or more that are prevailing is possibly even more
" In 2015, the MNRE set the target for Wind Power generation capacity by the year 2022 at 60,000 MW"
 East and North east regions have no grid connected wind power plant as of December 2017
 No offshore wind farm is under implementation as of December 2017
" However, an Offshore Wind Policy was announced in 2015 and presently weather stations and LIDARs are being set up by NIWE at some locations"
 The first offshore wind farm is planned near Dhanushkodi in Tamil Nadu
" India started planning in 2010 to enter into offshore wind power,[36] and a 100 MW demonstration plant located off the Gujarat coast began planning in 2014"
" In 2013, a consortium (instead of group of organizations), led by Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) started project FOWIND (Facilitating Offshore Wind in India) to identify potential zones for development of off-shore wind power in India and to stimulate R & D activities in this area"
" The other consortium partners include the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), DNV GL, the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL) and the World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE)"
 The consortium was awarded the grant of €4
0 million by the delegation of the European Union to India in 2013 besides co-funding support from GPCL
 The project action will be implemented from December 2013 to March 2018
 The project focuses on the States of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for identification of potential zones for development through techno-commercial analysis and preliminary resource assessment
" It will also establish a platform for structural collaboration and knowledge sharing between stakeholders from European Union and India, on offshore wind technology, policy, regulation, industry and human resource development"
 FOWIND activities will also help facilitate a platform to stimulate offshore wind related R&D activities in the country
 The consortium published initial pre-feasibility assessment reports for offshore wind farm development in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu on 16 June 2015
"In September 2015, the India's cabinet has approved the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy"
" With this, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has been authorized as the Nodal Ministry for use of offshore areas within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)[41] India seems pacing up rapidly towards offshore wind energy development as the Nodal Ministry (MNRE) & Nodal Agency (NIWE) calls with the Expression of Interest (EoI) [42] inviting the bidders for development of first 1000MW commercial scale offshore windfarm in India, near the coast of Gujarat"
" The EoI published on 16th Apr 2018, specifies the proposed area identified under the FOWIND & FOWPI study funded by European Union"
" The proposed location of the offshore windfarm could be 23-40km off the coast from the Pipavav port, Gulf of Khambhat"
 The proposed area covers about 400sq km
 The wind measurements & other data collection are under progress under the supervision of NIWE
 Solar power in India is a fast developing industry
 The country's solar installed capacity reached 29
55 GW as of 30 June 2019
 India has the lowest capital cost per MW globally to install the solar power plants
" The Indian government had an initial target of 20 GW capacity for 2022, which was achieved four years ahead of schedule"
" In 2015 the target was raised to 100 GW of solar capacity (including 40 GW from rooftop solar) by 2022, targeting an investment of US$100 billion"
" India expanded its solar-generation capacity 8 times from 2,650 MW on 26 May 2014 to over 20 GW as on 31 January 2018"
" The country added 3 GW of solar capacity in 2015-2016, 5 GW in 2016-2017 and over 10 GW in 2017-2018, with the average current price of solar electricity dropping to 18% below the average price of its coal-fired counterpart"
 Rooftop solar power accounts for 3
"4 GW, of which 70% is industrial or commercial"
" In addition to its large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) initiative, India is developing off-grid solar power for local energy needs"
" Solar products have increasingly helped to meet rural needs; by the end of 2015 just under one million solar lanterns were sold in the country, reducing the need for kerosene"
" That year, 118,700 solar home lighting systems were installed and 46,655 solar street lighting installations were provided under a national program; just over 1"
4 million solar cookers were distributed in India
" With about 300 clear and sunny days in a year, the calculated solar energy incidence on India's land area is about 5000 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year (or 5 EWh/yr)"
 The solar energy available in a single year exceeds the possible energy output of all of the fossil fuel energy reserves in India
 The daily average solar-power-plant generation capacity in India is 0
"20 kWh per m2 of used land area, equivalent to 1400–1800 peak (rated) capacity operating hours in a year with available, commercially-proven technology"
"In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President François Hollande laid the foundation stone for the headquarters of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in Gwal Pahari, Gurgaon"
 The ISA will focus on promoting and developing solar energy and solar products for countries lying wholly or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
 The alliance of over 120 countries was announced at the Paris COP21 climate summit
" One hope of the ISA is that wider deployment will reduce production and development costs, facilitating the increased deployment of solar technologies to poor and remote regions"
"In August 2016, the forecast for solar photovoltaic installations was about 4"
The country's solar capacity reached 19
"7 GW by the end of 2017, making it the third-largest global solar market"
 The installed capacity of commercial solar thermal power plants (non storage type) in India is 227
 Solar thermal plants with thermal storage are emerging as cheaper (US 7
"15/KWh) and clean load following power plants to supply electricity round the clock,[91][92] working as dispatchable generation"
 Solar panels can be located in the space between the towers of wind-power plants
This auxiliary power requirement can be made available from cheaper solar PV plant by envisaging hybrid solar plant with a mix of solar thermal and solar PV plants at a site
" Generating hot water or air or steam using concentrated solar reflectors, is increasing rapidly"
Cogeneration of steam and power round the clock is also feasible with solar thermal CHP plants with storage capacity
 The lack of an electricity infrastructure is a hurdle to rural India's development
" India's power grid is under-developed, with large groups of people still living off the grid"
"In 2004, about 80,000 of the nation's villages still did not have electricity, 18,000 out of them could not be electrified by extending the conventional grid due to in-convenice"
" A target of electrifying 5,000 such villages was set for the 2002–2007 Five-Year Plan"
"It could bypass (or relieve) expensive, long-distance, centralized power-delivery systems, bringing inexpensive electricity to large groups of people"
India has sold or distributed about 1
2 million solar home-lighting systems and 3
"2 million solar lanterns, and has been ranked the top Asian market for solar off-grid products"
"By 2012, a total of 4,600,000 solar lanterns and 861,654 solar-powered home lights were installed"
" Typically replacing kerosene lamps, they can be purchased for the cost of a few months' worth of kerosene with a small loan"
" The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is offering a 30- to 40-percent subsidy of the cost of lanterns, home lights and small systems (up to 210 Wp)"
Twenty million solar lamps are expected by 2022 
 Lamps and lighting 
 Solar photovoltaic water-pumping systems are used for irrigation and drinking water
"Most pumps are fitted with a 200–3,000 W (0"
"02 hp) motor powered with a 1,800 Wp PV array which can deliver about 140,000 litres (37,000 US gal) of water per day from a total hydraulic head of 10 m (33 ft)"
" By 30 September 2006 a total of 7,068 solar photovoltaic water pumping systems were installed,[113] and 7,771 were installed by March 2012"
" During hot sunny daytime when the water needs are more for watering the fields, solar pumps performance can be improved by maintaining pumped water flowing/sliding over the solar panels to keep them cooler and clean"
 Solar driers are used to dry harvests for storage
" Low cost solar powered bicycles are also available to ply between fields and village for agricultural activity, etc"
" In India, large areas are being covered by solar PV panels every year"
" Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rainwater falling on them and drinking or breweries water quality, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple filtration and disinfection processes, as rainwater is very low in salinity"
"Good quality water resources, closer to populated areas, are becoming a scarcity and increasingly costly for consumers"
 Exploitation of rainwater for value-added products like bottled drinking water makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall and cloudy areas by the increased income from drinking water generation 
" Nuclear power is the fifth-largest source of electricity in India after coal, gas, hydroelectricity and wind power"
" As of March 2018, India has 22 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants, having a total installed capacity of 6,780 MW"
 Nuclear power produced a total of 35 TWh and supplied 3
" 7 more reactors are under construction with a combined generation capacity of 4,300 MW"
"In October 2010, India drew up a plan to reach a nuclear power capacity of 63 GW in 2032, but after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan people around proposed Indian nuclear power plant sites have launched protests, raising questions about atomic energy as a clean and safe alternative to fossil fuels"
" There have been mass protests against the French-backed 9,900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and the Russian-backed 2,000 MW Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu"
" The state government of West Bengal, has also refused permission to a proposed 6,000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors"
 A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear programme at the Supreme Court
 Nuclear power in India has suffered from generally low capacity factors
" As of 2017, the lifetime weighted energy availability factor of the Indian fleet is 63"
 The availability factor of Indian reactors was 69
 One of the main reasons for the low capacity factors is lack of nuclear fuel
"As early as 1901, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) had recognised India as potentially having significant deposits of radioactive ores, including pitchblende, uranium and thorianite"
" In the ensuing 50 years, however, little to no effort was made to exploit those resources"
" During the 1920s and 1930s, Indian scientists maintained close links to their counterparts in Europe and the United States, and were well aware of the latest developments in physics"
" Krishnan, conducted pioneering research in nuclear physics in Europe during the 1930s"
" By 1939, Meghnad Saha, the Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta, had recognised the significance of the discovery of nuclear fission, and had begun to conduct various experiments in his laboratory related to nuclear physics"
" In the same year, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust sanctioned funds for installing a cyclotron at the University of Calcutta, but various difficulties likely related to the war delayed the project"
" He requested funds to establish a research institute of fundamental physics, ""with special reference to cosmic rays and nuclear physics"
" The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) was inaugurated in Mumbai the following year. s of 2009, India envisages to increase the contribution of nuclear power to overall electricity generation capacity from 2.8% to 9% within 25 years.[100] By 2020, India's installed nuclear power generation capacity was expected to increase to 20 GW.[101]. But the 2020 capacity will not exceed 7 GW, as the 2018 operating capacity is 6.2 GW, and only one more reactor is expected on line before 2020. As of 2018, India stands 13th in the world in terms nuclear capacity. Indigenous atomic reactors include TAPS-3, and -4, both of which are 540 MW reactors."
