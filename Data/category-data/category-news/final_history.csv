572, Major Approaches to the History of Modern India Looking at how histories are written is part of the study of the intellectual history of the period under discussion and can provide a variety of ideas and explanations
573," The starting point in the history of a society, therefore, has to be a familiarity with its historiographythe study of historical interpretation"
574," This provides recognition of the intellectual context of history, instead of seeing history as just a narration of events"
575," The modern history of India, for the convenience of understanding, can be broadly read under four approaches the Colonial (or the Imperialist), Nationalist, Marxist, and Subalterneach with its own distinct characteristics and modes of interpretation"
576," However, there are other approaches Communalist, Cambridge, Liberal and Neoliberal, and Feminist interpretationswhich have also influenced historical writing on modern India"
577, View The production of histories of India has become very frequent in recent years and may well call for some explanationsâ€¦ The reason is a twofold one: changes in the Indian scene requiring a reinterpretation of the facts and changes in the attitudes of historians about the essential elements of Indian history
578,  A Brief History of Modern India  Colonial Approach/ Historiography For the major part of the 19th century the Colonial School occupied a high position in India
579, The term 'colonial approach' has been used in two senses
580," One relates to the history of the colonial countries, while the other refers to the works which were influenced by the colonial ideology of domination"
581, It is in the second sense that most historians today write about the colonial historiography
582," In fact, the practice of writing about the colonial countries by the colonial officials was related to the desire for domination and justification of the colonial rule"
583," Hence, in most such historical works there was criticism of indigenous society and culture"
584," Simultaneously, there was praise for the Western culture and values and glorification of the individuals who established the colonial empires"
585," The histories of India written by James Mill, Mountstuart Elphinstone, Vincent Smith and many others are pertinent examples of the colonial historiographical trend"
586, Certain characteristics common to most of the works of these historians are the following: (i)'Orientalist' representation of India
587, The opinion that the British brought unity to India
588, The notions of Social Darwinismthe English considered themselves superior to the'natives' and the fittest to rule
589, India viewed as a stagnant society which required guidance from the British (White Man's burden)
590, and  establishing Pax Britannica to bring law and order and peace to a bickering society
591,"  Nationalist Historiography/ Approach The nationalist approach to Indian history can be described as one which tended to contribute to the growth of nationalist feelings and to unify people in the face of religious, caste,        Major Approaches to the History of Modern India  17  or linguistic differences or class differentiation"
592," This approach looks at the national movement as a movement of the Indian people, which grew out of the growing awareness among all people of the exploitative nature of colonial rule"
593, This approach developed as a response to and in confrontation with the colonial approach
594, It should be noted that the nationalist historians of modern India didn't exist before 1947
595," Before 1947, nationalist historiography mainly dealt with the ancient and medieval periods of Indian history"
596," Although, in the last quarter of the 19th century, a detailed and scientific critique of colonialism for the adverse economic aspects of alien rule was developed by nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, M"
597, Desai's Social Background of Indian Nationalism
598," Originally written for the famous Left Book Club in England, India Today, first published in 1940 in England, was later published in India in 1947"
599," Desai's Social Background of Indian Nationalism, was first published in 1948"
600," Unlike the imperialist/colonial approach, the Marxist historians clearly see the primary contradiction between the interests of the colonial masters and the subject people, as well as the process of the nationinthemaking"
601," Unlike the nationalists, they also take full note of the inner contradictions between the different sections of the people of the Indian society"
602," However, some of them, particularly Rajni Palme    A Brief History of Modern India  Dutt, were unable to fully integrate their treatment of the primary antiimperialist contradiction and the secondary inner contradictions and tended to counterbalance the antiimperialist struggle with the class or social struggle"
603," They tend to see the national movement as a structured bourgeois movement, if not the bourgeoisie's movement, and miss its open ended and allclass character"
604," Another noted Marxist historian, who made a critique of RP  "
605, he considers Dutt's paradigm as a 'simplistic version of the Marxian class approach
606, He looks at the nationalist leaders in the light of intelligentsia which acts as a 'kind of proxy for as yet passive social forces with which it had little organic connection
607," Desai traces the growth of the national movement in five phases, each phase based on particular social classes which supported and sustained it"
608,"  Subaltern Approach/ Historiography This school of thought began in the early 1980s under the editorship of Ranajit Guha, as a critique of the existing historiography, which was faulted for ignoring the voice of the people"
609," Right from the beginning, subaltern historiography took the position that the entire tradition of Indian historiography had had an elitist bias"
610," For the subaltern historians, the basic contradiction in Indian society in the colonial epoch was between the elite, both Indian and foreign, on the one hand, and the subaltern groups, on the other, and not between colonialism and the Indian people"
611," However, they do not subscribe to the Marxist theory of the nature of the exploitation by the nationalist movement: they point out that the Indian society of the time could not be seen in terms of class only as capitalism in the country was just nascent at the time"
612," This school sees nationalism as exploitative in terms of caste, gender, religious and creed divisions"
613,"        Major Approaches to the History of Modern India  19  View A few historians have of late initiated a new trend, described by its proponents as subaltern, which dismisses all previous historical writing, including that based on a Marxist perspective, as elite historiography, and claims to replace this old,'blinkered' historiography with what it claims is a new people's or subaltern approach"
614," Bipan Chandra  Nationalism, say the subalterns, ignored the internal contradictions within the society as well as what the marginalised represented or had to say"
615," They believe that the Indian people were never united in a common antiimperialist struggle, that there was no such entity as the Indian national movement"
616," Instead, they assert, there were two distinct movements or streams: the real antiimperialist stream of the subalterns and the bogus national movement of the elite"
617," The elite streams, led by the'official' leadership of the Indian National Congress, were little more than a cloak for the struggle for power among the elite"
618,"  Communalist Approach The historians of this school, relying completely on the colonial historiography of medieval India and colonial era textbooks, viewed Hindus and Muslims as permanent hostile groups whose interests were mutually different and antagonistic to each other"
619, This view was not only reflected in the writings of the historians but it also found a more virulent form in the hands of the communal political leaders
620," In their view, India's medieval history was one long story of HinduMuslim conflict"
621," As a corollary of this view, it was then argued that the 19th and 20thcentury Muslims had the'happy' and'proud' everpresent memory of having been the ruling class, while Hindus had the'sad' and'humiliating' memory of having been the subject race"
622,"  A Brief History of Modern India  developed mutual hatred among these groups often resulting in communal riots and, in the end led to the partition of India"
623,"  Cambridge School According to this school of thought, the fundamental contradiction under colonial rule was not between imperialism and the Indian people, but among the Indians themselves"
624," Further, Indian nationalism was not the product of a struggle of the Indian people against colonial exploitation, but what arose from conflict among the Indians for getting the benefits given to them by the British rulers"
625," The leaders of the national movement, according to this school, were inspired by the quest for power and material benefits"
626, This approach has been criticised by many scholars on the ground that it takes the mind or ideals out of human behaviour and reduces nationalism to'animal politics'
627,"  Liberal and NeoLiberal Interpretations According to this interpretation, the economic exploitation of the colonies was not beneficial to the British people as a whole"
628, The availability of markets for British industrial goods in the colonial world and capital investment in overseas markets (like laying of railways in India) might have actually discouraged domestic investment and delayed the development of the'new' industries in Britain
629," The proponents of this school of thought are Patrick O'Brian, Hopkins and Cain"
630,  Feminist Historiography The shift in terms of the writing of women's history began with the women's movement of the 1970s which provided the context and impetus for the emergence of women's studies in India
631," Very soon, women's history broadened and assumed the more complex shape of gender history"
632," In the Major Approaches to the History of Modern India  21  early years, the endeavour was to write a history of women to supplement the writings of mainstream history"
633," Also, an attempt was made to research and compile an archive of women's writing"
634," An important area of research has been analysis of the way in which colonial structures, such as the legal structure, affected women's lives"
635," Women's vulnerability due to the denial of ownership of productive resources has been focused on, in the analysis of how progressive laws shaped gender relations"
636," In the colonial period, two works based upon the women's question in IndiaThe High Caste Hindu Woman (1887) by Pandita Ramabai, and Mother India (1927) by Katherine Mayoattracted international attention"
637,  Summary Different Approaches Colonial Approach is influenced by the colonial ideology of domination
638," It focuses on criticism of indigenous society and culture, and praises the Western culture and values"
639," James Mill, Vincent Smith etc"
640, Nationalist Approach evolved as a response to and in confrontation with the colonial approach
641," Before independence, this school dealt with the ancient and medieval periods of Indian history, and not the modern period"
642, After independence this school focused on modern India
643, Marxist Approach focuses on the primary contradiction between the interests of the colonial masters and the native subjects
644, It also takes notice of the inner contradictions between the different sections of Indian society
645, R P Dutt and A R Desai were noted Marxist historians of India
646, Subaltern Approach takes the position that the entire tradition of Indian historiography has an elitist bias and the role of the common masses has been neglected
647, Ranajit Guha belonged to this school
648, A Brief History of Modern India  Communalist Approach views Hindus and Muslims as permanent the hostile groups whose interests are mutually different and antagonistic to each other
649, Cambridge School envisages Indian nationalism as a product of conflicts among the Indians themselves for getting the benefits from the British rulers
650, For them Indian nationalist leaders were inspired by the greed of power and material benefits
651, Liberal and Neoliberal Interpretations imply that the economic exploitation of the colonies was not beneficial to the people of Britain as it delayed the development of the'new' industries in Britain
652," Feminist Historiography focuses on areas of research that analyse colonial structures, such as the legal structure, which affected women's lives"
653, It also focuses on women's vulnerability due to the denial of ownership of productive resources
654,"  Though we talk of ancient, medieval and modern periods in history, history is a continuity"
655, It is not always easy to distinguish clearly when one period ends and another begins
656," So if we think of the history of modern India as beginning with the advent of the Europeans, we need to go back to what is generally considered the medieval period"

658,"  The Portuguese in India The Quest for and Discovery of a Sea Route to India After the decline of the Roman Empire in the seventh century, the Arabs had established their domination in Egypt and Persia"
659," Direct contact between the Europeans and India declined and, with that, the easy accessibility to the Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and various precious stones that were greatly in demand was affected"
660," In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the ascendant"
661, Merchandise from India went to the European markets through Arab Muslim intermediaries
662, The Red Sea trade route was a state monopoly from which Islamic rulers earned tremendous revenues
663, The land routes to India were also controlled by the Arabs
664," In the circumstances, the Europeans were keen to find a direct sea route to India"
665, A Brief History of Modern India  Fifteenthcentury Europe was gripped by the spirit of the Renaissance with its call for exploration
666," At the same time, Europe made great advances in the art of shipbuilding and navigation"
667," Hence, there was an eagerness all over Europe for adventurous sea voyages to reach the unknown corners of the East"
668," The economic development of many regions of Europe was also progressing rapidly with expansion of land under cultivation, the introduction of an improved plough, scientific crop management such as crop rotation, and increased supply of meat (which called for spices for cooking as well as preservation)"
669, Prosperity also grew and with it the demand for oriental luxury goods also increased
670, Venice and Genoa which had earlier prospered through trade in oriental goods were too small to take on the mighty Ottoman Turks or to take up major exploration on their own
671," The north Europeans were ready to aid Portugal and Spain with money and men, even as the Genoese were ready to provide ships and technical knowledge"
672, It is also to be noted that Portugal had assumed the leadership in Christendom's resistance to Islam even as it had taken on itself the spirit of exploration that had characterised the Genoese
673," Historians have observed that the idea of finding an ocean route to India had become an obsession for Prince Henry of Portugal, who was nicknamed the'Navigator'"
674, He was keen to find a way to circumvent the Muslim domination of the eastern Mediterranean and all the routes that connected India to Europe
675," Pope Nicholas V gave Prince Henry a bull in 1454, conferring on him the right to navigate the 'sea to the distant shores of the Orient', more specifically 'as far as India' in an attempt to fight Islamic influence and spread the Christian faith"
676," However, Prince Henry died before his dream became a reality"
677," In 1497, under the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the rulers of Portugal and Spain divided the nonChristian world between them by an imaginary line in the Atlantic, some 1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands"
678," Under the treaty, Portugal could claim and occupy everything to the east of     Advent of the Europeans in India the line while Spain could claim everything to the west"
679, The situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into the waters around India
680," It was in 1487 that the Portuguese navigator, Bartholomew Dias, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and sailed up the eastern coast"
681," But it was only ten years later that an expedition of Portuguese ships headed out to India (in 1497) and arrived in India in slightly less than eleven months' time, in May 1498"
682,"  From Trading to Ruling Vasco Da Gama The arrival of three ships under Vasco Da Gama, led by a Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid, at Calicut in May 1498 profoundly affected the course of Indian history"
683," The Hindu ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin (Samuthiri), however, had no apprehensions as to the European's intentions"
684," As the prosperity of his kingdom was due to Calicut's position as an entrepot, he accorded a friendly reception to Vasco Da Gama"
685," The Arab traders, who had a good business on the Malabar coast were apprehensive and were not keen on the Portuguese getting a hold there"
686," For centuries, the trading system in the Indian Ocean had had numerous participantsIndians, Arabs, Africans from the east coast, Chinese, Javanese, among othersbut these participants had acted according to some tacit rules of conduct and none had sought overwhelming dominance though all were in it for profit"
687," The Portuguese changed that: they wanted to monopolise the hugely profitable eastern trade by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs"
688, Vasco da Gama stayed in India for three months
689," When he returned to Portugal, he carried back with him a rich cargo and sold the merchandise in the European market at a huge profit"
690," The importance of direct access to the pepper trade was made clear by the fact that elsewhere the Europeans, who had to buy through Muslim middlemen, would have had to    28      A Brief History of Modern India View  The landing of Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 "
691," is generally regarded as the beginning of a new era in world history, especially in the relationship between Asia and Europe"
692," Although Asia and Europe had been in commercial relations with each other since antiquity, the opening of the direct searelations between the two was not only the fulfilment of an old dream (according to the Greek historian, Herodotus, the Phoenicians had rounded Africa in the 6th century BC) it presaged big increase of trade between the two"
693," This, however, was only one of the objectives of the Portuguese"
694," For the Portuguese, the opening of a new searoute to India would give a big blow to the Muslims, the Arabs and Turks, who were the traditional enemies of Christianity, and were posing a new threat to Europe by virtue of the growing military and naval power of the Turks"
695," A direct sealink with India would displace the virtual monopoly of the Arabs and Turks over the trade in eastern goods, especially spices"
696," They also vaguely hoped by their exploration of Africa they would be able to link up with the kingdom of the legendary Prior John, and be in a position to attack the Muslims from two sides"
697," Thus, the commercial and religious objectives supported and justified each other"
698, Satish Chandra  spend ten times as much for the same amount of pepper
699," Not surprisingly, other profitseeking merchants of European nations were tempted to come to India and trade directly"
700," A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to trade for spices, negotiating and establishing a factory at Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500"
701," There was an incident of conflict when the Portuguese factory at Calicut was attacked by the locals, resulting in the death of several Portuguese"
702," In retaliation, Cabral seized a number of Arab merchant ships anchored in the harbour, and killed hundreds of their crew besides confiscating their cargo and burning the ships"
703, Calicut was bombarded by Cabral
704," Later, Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties with the local rulers of Cochin and Cannanore"

707, His rupture with the Zamorin thus became total and complete
708, Vasco da Gama set up a trading factory at Cannanore
709," Gradually, Calicut, Cannanore and Cochin became the important trade centres of the Portuguese"
710," Gradually, under the pretext of protecting the factories and their trading activities, the Portuguese got permission to fortify these centres"
711,"  Francisco De Almeida In 1505, the King of Portugal appointed a governor in India for a threeyear term and equipped the incumbent with sufficient force to protect the Portuguese interests"
712," Francisco De Almeida, the newly appointed governor, was asked to consolidate the position of the Portuguese in India and to destroy Muslim trade by seizing Aden, Ormuz and Malacca"
713," He was also advised to build fortresses at Anjadiva, Cochin, Cannanore and Kilwa"
714," What Almeida, however, encountered along with the opposition of the Zamorin, was a threat from the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt"
715," Encouraged by the merchants of Venice whose lucrative commerce was now at risk due to the Portuguese interference, the Egyptians raised a fleet in the Red Sea to stop the advance of the Portuguese"
716," In 1507, the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off Diu by the combined Egyptian and Gujarat navies, and Almeida's son was killed"
717," Next year, Almeida avenged his defeat by totally crushing the two navies"
718, Almeida's vision was to make the Portuguese the master of the Indian Ocean

723, He secured for Portugal the strategic control of the Indian Ocean by establishing bases overlooking all the entrances to the sea
724," There were Portuguese strongholds in East Africa, off the Red Sea, at Ormuz"
725," The Portuguese, under Albuquerque bolstered their stranglehold by introducing a permit system for other ships and exercising control over the major shipbuilding centres in the region"
726, The nonavailability of timber in the Gulf and Red Sea regions for shipbuilding also helped the Portuguese in their objectives
727, Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 with ease
728, the principal port of the Sultan of Bijapur became 'the first bit of Indian territory to be under the Europeans since the time of Alexander the Great'
729, An interesting feature of his rule was the abolition of sati
730," The Portuguese men who had come on the voyages and stayed back in India were, from Albuquerque's day, encouraged to take local wives"
731," In Goa and the Province of the North they established themselves as village landlords, often building new roads and irrigation works, introducing new crops like tobacco and cashew nut, or better plantation varieties of coconut besides planting large groves of coconut to meet the need for coir rigging and cordage"
732," In the cities, such as Goa and Cochin, they settled as artisans and mastercraftsmen, besides being traders"
733," Most of such Portuguese came to look upon their new settlements, rather than Portugal, as home"
734, View Bitter persecution of Muslims was one serious drawback of Albuquerque's policy
735, This could have been due to his resolve to further the interests of his countrymen by complete extinction of Muslim commercial interests in the East
736," During his rule, Albuquerque did his best to strengthen the fortifications of Goa and enhance its commercial importance"
737, In order to secure a permanent Portuguese population in India he encouraged his men to take Indian wives

740, He also promised them a base in Diu
741," However, Bahadur Shah's relations with the Portuguese became sour when Humayun withdrew from Gujarat in 1536"
742," Since the inhabitants of the town started fighting with the Portuguese, Bahadur Shah wanted to raise a wall of partition"
743," Opposing this, the Portuguese started negotiations, in the course of which the ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed in 1537"
744, Da Cunha also attempted to increase Portuguese influence in Bengal by settling many Portuguese nationals there with Hooghly as their headquarters
745,"  Favourable Conditions for Portuguese In India, excepting Gujarat, ruled by the powerful Mahmud Begarha (14581511), the northern part was much divided among many small powers"
746," In the Deccan, the Bahmani Kingdom was breaking up into smaller kingdoms"
747," None of the powers had a navy worth its name, nor did they think of developing their naval strength"
748," In the Far East, the imperial decree of the Chinese emperor limited the navigational reach of the Chinese ships"
749," As regards the Arab merchants and shipowners who until then dominated the Indian Ocean trade, they had nothing to match the organisation and unity of the Portuguese"
750," Moreover, the Portuguese had cannons placed on their ships"
751,  Portuguese State The general tendency is to underestimate the Portuguese hold in India
752," However, the Estado PortuguÃªs da India (State of the Portuguese India) was in fact a larger element in Indian history than it is given credit for"
753, A Brief History of Modern India  of India had come under Portuguese power within fifty years of Vasco da Gama's arrival
754, The Portuguese had occupied some sixty miles of coast around Goa
755," On the west coast from Mumbai to Daman and Diu to the approaches to Gujarat, they controlled a narrow tract with four important ports and hundreds of towns and villages"
756," In the south, they had under them a chain of seaport fortresses and tradingposts like Mangalore, Cannanore, Cochin, and Calicut"
757," And though their power in Malabar was not consolidated, it was enough to ensure influence or control over the local rulers who held the spice growing land"
758, The Portuguese established further military posts and settlements on the east coast at San Thome (in Chennai) and Nagapatnam (in Andhra)
759," Towards the end of the sixteenth century, a wealthy settlement had grown at Hooghly in West Bengal"
760, Envoys and ambassadors were exchanged between Goa and many of the major kingdoms in India of the time
761, Treaties were signed between Goa and the Deccan sultans in 1570 which were regularly renewed as long as their kingdoms lasted
762," The Portuguese always had a role to play in the successive battles for the balance of power between Vijayanagara and the Deccan sultans, between the Deccanis and the Mughals, and between the Mughals and the Marathas"
763," Interestingly, the Portuguese, the first Europeans to come to India, were also the last to leave this land"
764," It was 1961 before the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman and Diu from them"
765,"  Portuguese Administration in India The head of the administration was the viceroy who served for three years, with his secretary and, in later years, a council"
766," Next in importance came the Vedor da Fazenda, responsible for revenues and the cargoes and dispatch of fleets"
767," The fortresses, from Africa to China, were under captains, assisted by'factors', whose power was increased by the difficulties of communication and was too often used for personal ends"
768,      Advent of the Europeans in India    33  Religious Policy of the Portuguese The Moors were the bitter enemies of the Portuguese in North Africa
769," Arriving in the East, the Portuguese brought with them the same zeal to promote Christianity and the wish to persecute all Muslims"
770," Intolerant towards the Muslims, the Portuguese were initially quite tolerant towards the Hindus"
771," However, over time, after the introduction of the Inquisition in Goa, there was a change and Hindus were also persecuted"
772," But, in spite of this intolerant behaviour, the Jesuits made a good impression at the court of Akbar, mainly due to the Mughal emperor's interest in questions of theology"
773," In September 1579, Akbar forwarded a letter to the authorities at Goa requesting them to send two learned priests"
774," The Church authorities in Goa eagerly accepted the invitation, seeing in it a chance to convert the emperor to Christianity, and with him his court and the people"
775," Jesuit fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate were selected for the purpose"
776," When they reached Fatehpur Sikri on February 28, 1580, they were received with honour"
777," Aquaviva and Monserrate went back in 1583, belying the hopes the Portuguese entertained of Akbar's conversion to the Christian faith"
778, The second mission called by Akbar in 1590 also ended on a similar note in 1592
779," The third mission, again invited by Akbar, arrived in 1595 at Lahore (where the court was then residing) and continued as a sort of permanent institution, thereby extending its influence on secular politics"
780," Fathers Jerome Xavier and Emanuel Pinheiro were the leaders of the mission, and their letters from the court became very widely known for the information they provided on the latter part of Akbar's reign"
781," Prince Salim, on ascending the throne as Jahangir, assuaged the Muslims by neglecting the Jesuit fathers"
782," Gradually, however, his temporary estrangement from the Jesuits ended, and in 1606 he again renewed his favours to them"
783, The elegant and spacious church at Lahore was allowed to be retained by them along with the collegium or the    34      A Brief History of Modern India  priests' residence
784," In 1608, twenty baptisms were carried out in Agra, the priests publicly acting with as much liberty as in Portugal"
785, Jahangir's conduct was such that the Jesuit priests became hopeful of bringing him within the Christian fold
786," However, these hopes were belied"
787," Moreover, arrogant actions on the part of the Portuguese viceroys created a rift with the Mughal emperor"
788,"  Portuguese Lose Favour with the Mughals In 1608, Captain William Hawkins with his ship Hector reached Surat"
789," He brought with him a letter from James I, King of England, to the Mughal court of Jahangir requesting permission to do business in India"
790," Father Pinheiro and the Portuguese authorities did their best to prevent Hawkins from reaching the Mughal court, but did not succeed"
791, Jahangir accepted the gifts Hawkins brought for him and gave Hawkins a very favourable reception in 1609
792," As Hawkins knew the Turki language well, he conversed with the emperor in that language without the aid of an interpreter"
793," Pleased with Hawkins, Jahangir appointed him as a mansabdar of 400 at a salary of Rs 30,000 (apparently, he never received it)"
794, Hawkins was also married to the daughter of an Armenian Christian named Mubarak Shah (Mubarikesha)
795, The grant of trading facilities to the English offended the Portuguese
796," However, after negotiations, a truce was established between the Portuguese and the Mughal emperor"
797, The Portuguese stopped the English ships from entering the port of Surat
798," A baffled Hawkins left the Mughal court in 1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues or check the vacillating Mughal policies"
799," However, in November 1612, the English ship Dragon under Captain Best along with a little ship, the Osiander, successfully fought a Portuguese fleet"
800," Jahangir, who had no navy worth its name, learnt of the English success and was greatly impressed"
801,      Advent of the Europeans in India    35  The Portuguese acts of piracy also resulted in conflict with the imperial Mughal government
802," In 1613, the Portuguese offended Jehangir by capturing Mughal ships, imprisoning many Muslims, and plundering the cargoes"
803," An enraged Jahangir ordered Muqarrab Khan, who was the then in charge of Surat, to obtain compensation"
804," However, it was during the reign of Shah Jahan, that the advantages which the Portuguese enjoyed in the Mughal court were lost forever"
805," Also lost were the hopes of converting the royal family and Mughal India to Christianity, a hope that the Portuguese held because of the welcome accorded to them and their religion by Akbar and Jahangir"
806,"  Capture of Hooghly On the basis of an imperial farman circa 1579, the Portuguese had settled down on a river bank which was a short distance from Satgaon in Bengal to carry on their trading activities"
807," Over the years, they strengthened their position by constructing big buildings which led to the migration of the trade from Satgaon to the new port known as Hooghly"
808," They monopolised the manufacture of salt, built a custom house of their own and started enforcing strictly the levy of duty on tobacco, which had become an important article of trade since its introduction at the beginning of the 17th century"
809," The Portuguese not only made money as traders but also started a cruel slave trade by purchasing or seizing Hindu and Muslim children, whom they brought up as Christians"
810," In the course of their nefarious activities, they seized two slave girls of Mumtaz Mahal"
811," On June 24, 1632, the siege of Hooghly began, ending in its capture three months later"
812, Shah Jahan ordered the Bengal governor Qasim Khan to take action against the Portuguese
813, A siege of Hooghly finally led to the Portuguese fleeing
814," The Mughals suffered a loss of 1,000 men, but also took 400 prisoners to Agra"
815, The prisoners were offered the option to convert to Islam or become slaves
816, The persecution of Christians continued for some time after which it died down gradually
817,"    A Brief History of Modern India  Decline of the Portuguese By the 18th century, the Portuguese in India lost their commercial influence, though some of them still carried on trade in their individual capacity and many took to piracy and robbery"
818," In fact, Hooghly was used by some Portuguese as a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal"
819, The decline of the Portuguese was brought about by several factors
820," The local advantages gained by the Portuguese in India were reduced with the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia and North India and the rise of the turbulent Marathas as their immediate neighbours"
821, The Marathas captured Salsette and Bassein in 1739 from the Portuguese
822," The religious policies of the Portuguese, such as the activities of the Jesuits, gave rise to political fears"
823," Their antagonism for the Muslims apart, the Portuguese policy of conversion to Christianity made Hindus also resentful"
824, Their dishonest trade practices also evoked a strong reaction
825, The Portuguese earned notoriety as sea pirates
826, Their arrogance and violence brought them the animosity of the rulers of small states and the imperial Mughals as well
827, The discovery of Brazil diverted colonising activities of Portugal to the West
828," The union of the two kingdoms of Spain and Portugal in 158081, dragging the smaller kingdom into Spain's wars with England and Holland, badly affected Portuguese monopoly of trade in India"
829, The earlier monopoly of knowledge of the sea route View The Portuguese entered India with the sword in one hand and the crucifix in the other

843," As new trading communities from Europe arrived in India, there began a fierce rivalry among them"
844," In this struggle, the Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and enterprising competitors"
845," The Dutch and the English had greater resources and more compulsions to expand overseas, and they overcame the Portuguese resistance"
846," One by one, the Portuguese possessions fell to its opponents"
847, Goa which remained with the Portuguese had lost its importance as a port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire and soon it did not matter in whose possession it was
848," The spice trade came under the control of the Dutch, and Goa was superseded by Brazil as the economic centre of the overseas empire of Portugal"
849," In 1683, after two naval assaults, the Marathas invaded Goa"
850,"  Significance of the Portuguese Most historians have observed that the coming of the Portuguese not only initiated what might be called the    38      A Brief History of Modern India  European era, it marked the emergence of naval power"
851," The Cholas, among others, had been a naval power, but it was now for the first time a foreign power had come to India by way of the sea"
852," The Portuguese ships carried cannon, and this was the first step in gaining monopoly over tradewith the threat or actual use of force"
853," The Portuguese declared their intention to abide by no rules except their own, and they were intent on getting a decisive advantage over the Indians and over the Indian Ocean trading system"
854," In the Malabar of the sixteenth century, the Portuguese showed military innovation in their use of body armour, matchlock men, and guns landed from the ships"
855," The Portuguese may have contributed by example to the Mughal use of field guns, and the'artillery of the stirrup'"
856," However, an important military contribution made by the Portuguese onshore was the system of drilling groups of infantry, on the Spanish model, introduced in the 1630s as a counter to Dutch pressure"
857," The practice was adopted first by the French and English, and later taken up by the Marathas and Sikhs, and such armies of sepoys became new tools of empire in India"
858, The Portuguese were masters of improved techniques at sea
859," Their multidecked ships were heavily constructed, designed as they were to ride out Atlantic gales rather than run before the regular monsoons"
860, Their use of castled prow and stern was a noteworthy method by which to repel or launch boarding parties
861, Indian builders adapted both to their own use
862," However, the Portuguese skill at organisationas in the creation of royal arsenals and dockyards and the maintenance of a regular system of pilots and mapping and pitting state forces against private merchant shippingwas even more noteworthy"
863,"The Mughals and Marathas may certainly have learnt from the Portuguese but the more certain heirs of this knowledge were other Europeans, especially the Dutch and English, in Asia"
864," In India, the memory of religious persecution and    cruelty detracts from the other contributions made by the Portuguese in the cultural field"
865," However, it cannot be forgotten that the missionaries and the Church were also teachers and patrons in India of the arts of the painter, carver, and sculptor"
866," As in music, they were the interpreters, not just of Portuguese, but of European art to India"
867," The art of the silversmith and goldsmith flourished at Goa, and the place became a centre of elaborate filigree work, fretted foliage work and metal work embedding jewels"
868," However, though the interior of churches built under the Portuguese have plenty of woodwork and sculpture and sometimes painted ceilings, they are generally simple in their architectural plan"
869,  The Dutch Commercial enterprise led the Dutch to undertake voyages to the East
870, Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutchman to reach Sumatra and Bantam in 1596
871," In 1602, the StatesGeneral of the Netherlands amalgamated many trading companies into the East India Company of the Netherlands"
872," This company was also empowered to carry on war, to conclude treaties, to take possession of territory and to erect fortresses"
873,"  Dutch Settlements After their arrival in India, the Dutch founded their first factory in Masulipatnam (in Andhra) in 1605"
874, They went on to establish trading centres at different parts of India and thus became a threat to the Portuguese
875, They captured Nagapatam near Madras (Chennai) from the Portuguese and made it their main stronghold in South India
876," The Dutch established factories on the Coromandel coast, in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Bihar"
877," In 1609, they opened a factory in Pulicat, north of Madras"
878," Their other principal factories in India were at Surat (1616), Bimlipatam (1641), Karaikal (1645), Chinsura (1653), Baranagar, Kasimbazar (near Murshidabad), Balasore, Patna, Nagapatam (1658) and Cochin (1663)"
879," Participating in the redistributive or carrying trade, they brought to the islands of the Far East various articles and merchandise from India"
880," They carried indigo manufactured in the Yamuna valley and Central India, textiles and silk from Bengal, Gujarat and the Coromandel, saltpetre from Bihar and opium and rice from the Ganga valley"
881,"  AngloDutch Rivalry The English were also at this time rising to prominence in the Eastern trade, and this posed a serious challenge to the commercial interests of the Dutch"
882, Commercial rivalry soon turned into bloody warfare
883," The climax of the enmity between the Dutch and the English in the East was reached at Amboyna (a place in presentday Indonesia, which the Dutch had captured from the Portuguese in 1605) where they massacred ten Englishmen and nine Japanese in 1623"
884, This incident further intensified the rivalry between the two European companies
885," After prolonged warfare, both the parties came to a compromise in 1667 by which the British agreed to withdraw all their claims on Indonesia, and the Dutch retired from India to concentrate on their more View The Dutch rivalry with the English, during the seventeenth century, was more bitter than that of the Portuguese"
886," The policy of the Dutch in the East was influenced by two motives: one was to take revenge on Catholic Spain, the foe of their independence, and her ally Portugal, and the other was to colonise and establish settlements in the East Indies with a view to monopolising commerce in that region"
887, They gained their first object by the gradual decline of Portuguese influence
888, The realisation of their second object brought them into bitter competition with the English
889, They monopolised the trade in black pepper and spices
890," The most important Indian commodities the Dutch traded in were silk, cotton, indigo, rice and opium"
891,  Decline of the Dutch in India The Dutch got drawn into the trade of the Malay Archipelago
892," Further, in the third AngloDutch War (167274), communications between Surat and the new English settlement of Bombay got cut due to which three homebound English ships were captured in the Bay of Bengal by the Dutch forces"
893," The retaliation by the English resulted in the defeat of the Dutch, in the battle of Hooghly (November 1759), which dealt a crushing blow to Dutch ambitions in India"
894, The Dutch were not much interested in empire building in India
895, their concerns were trade
896," In any case, their main commercial interest lay in the Spice Islands of Indonesia from where they earned a huge profit through business"
897,"  The English Charter of Queen Elizabeth I Francis Drake's voyage around the world in 1580 and the English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 generated a new sense of enterprise in the British, encouraging sailors to venture out to the East"
898," As the knowledge grew of the high profits earned by the Portuguese in Eastern trade, English traders too wanted a share"
899," So in 1599, a group of English merchants calling themselves the'Merchant Adventurers' formed a company"
900," On December 31, 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter with rights of exclusive trading to the company named the'Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies'"
901," Initially, a monopoly of fifteen years was granted, which in May 1609 was extended indefinitely by a fresh charter"
902," As the Dutch were already concentrating more on the East  Indies, the English turned to India in search of textiles and other commodities of trade"
903,  Progress of the English Company Foothold in West and South Captain Hawkins arrived in the court of Jahangir in April 1609 itself
904," But the mission to establish a factory at Surat didn't succeed due to opposition from the Portuguese, and Hawkins left Agra in November 1611"
905," In 1611, the English had started trading at Masulipatnam on the southeastern coast of India and later established a factory there in 1616"
906, It was in 1612 that Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese in the sea off Surat
907, An impressed Jahangir granted permission to the English in early 1613 to establish a factory at Surat under Thomas Aldworth
908," In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came as an accredited ambassador of James I to the court of Jahangir, staying on there till February 1619"
909," Though he was unsuccessful in concluding a commercial treaty with the Mughal emperor, he was able to secure a number of privileges, including permission to set up factories at Agra, Ahmedabad and Broach"
910, The English company did not have a smooth progress
911, It had to contend with the Portuguese and the Dutch in the beginning
912, But the changing situation helped them and turned things in their favour
913, Bombay had been gifted to King Charles II by the King of Portugal as dowry when Charles married the Portuguese princess Catherine in 1662
914, Bombay was given over to the East India Company on an annual payment of ten pounds only in 1668
915, Later Bombay was made the headquarters by shifting the seat of the Western Presidency from Surat to Bombay in 1687
916, So there was tacit peace between the English and the Portuguese now
917, There was also an AngloDutch compromise as mentioned earlier by which the Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English Company's trade in India
918, Thus the English were rid of two archrivals in India
919,The English Company's position was improved by the'Golden Farman' issued to them by the Sultan of Golconda in 1632
920," On a payment of 500 pagodas a year, they earned the privilege of trading freely in the ports of Golconda"
921," A member of the Masulipatnam council, the British merchant Francis Day, in 1639 received from the ruler of Chandragiri permission to build a fortified factory at Madras which later became the Fort St"
922, George and replaced Masulipatnam as the headquarters of the English settlements in south India
923," Thereafter, the English extended their trading activities to the east and started factories at Hariharpur in the Mahanadi delta and at Balasore (in Odisha) in 1633"
924,"  Foothold in Bengal Bengal was then a large and rich province in India, advanced in trade and commerce"
925, Commercial and political control over Bengal naturally appeared an attractive proposition to the profitseeking English merchants
926, Bengal was also an important province of the Mughal empire
927," Shah Shuja, the subahdar of Bengal in 1651, allowed the English to trade in Bengal in return for an annual payment of Rs 3,000, in lieu of all duties"
928," Factories in Bengal were started at Hooghly (1651) and other places like Kasimbazar, Patna and Rajmahal"
929," Nevertheless, despite the privileges of the farmans, the Company's business was now and then obstructed by customs officers in the local checkposts who asked for payment of tolls"
930," In pursuance of its changed policy, the Company wanted to have a fortified settlement at Hooghly so that force could be used if necessary"
931," William Hedges, the first agent and governor of the Company in Bengal, appealed to Shayista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal in August 1682, for redressal of the grievance"
932," As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals"
933," Four years later, Hooghly was sacked by the imperial Mughals in October 1686"
934," The English retaliated by capturing the imperial forts at Thana, raiding Hijli in east Midnapur and storming the Mughal fortifications at Balasore"
935," However, the English were forced to leave Hooghly and were sent to an unhealthy location at the mouth of the River Ganga"
936," After the Mughal raid on Hooghly, Job Charnock, a company agent, started negotiations with the Mughals so as to return to a place called Sutanuti"
937," Charnock signed a treaty with the Mughals in February 1690, and returned to Sutanuti in August 1690"
938," Thus, an English factory was established on February 10, 1691, the day an imperial farman was issued permitting the English to 'continue contentedly their trade in Bengal' on payment of Rs 3000 a year in lieu of all dues"
939," A zamindar in Bardhaman district, Sobha Singh, rebelled, subsequently giving the English the pretext they were looking for, to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696"
940," In 1698, the English succeeded in getting the permission to buy the zamindari of the three villages of Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata (Kalighat) from their owners on payment of Rs 1,200"
941, The fortified settlement was named Fort William in the year 1700 when it also became the seat of the eastern presidency (Calcutta) with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president
942,"  Farrukhsiyar's Farmans In 1715, an English mission led by John Surman to the court of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar secured three famous farmans, giving the Company many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad"
943, The farmans thus obtained were regarded the Magna Carta of the Company
944," Their important terms were — In Bengal, the Company's imports and exports were exempted from additional customs duties excepting the annual payment of 3,000 rupees as settled earlier"
945,The Company was permitted to issue dastaks (passes) for the transportation of such goods
946,The East India Company was established
947, 1609 : William Hawkins arrived at Jahangir's court
948, 1611 : Captain Middleton obtained the permission of the Mughal governor of Surat to trade there
949, 1613 : A permanent factory of East India Company was established at Surat
950," 1615 : Sir Thomas Roe, the ambassador of King James I, arrived at Jahangir's court"
951," By 1618, the ambassador succeeded in obtaining two farmans (one each from the emperor and Prince Khurram) confirming free trade with exemption from inland tolls"
952, 1616 : The Company established its first factory in the south in Masulipatnam
953, 1632 : The Company got the golden farman from the Sultan of Golconda which ensured safety and prosperity of their trade
954," 1633 : The Company established its first factory in east India in Hariharpur, Balasore (Odisha)"
955, 1639 : The Company got the lease of Madras from a local king
956, 1651 : The Company was given permission to trade at Hooghly (Bengal)
957," 1662 : The British King, Charles II, was given Bombay as dowry for marrying a Portuguese princess (Catherine of Braganza)"
958, 1667 : Aurangzeb gave the English a farman for trade in Bengal
959," 1691 : The Company got the imperial order to continue their trade in Bengal in lieu of payment of Rs 3,000 a year"
960," 1717 : The Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar issued a farman, called Magna Carta of the Company, giving the Company a large number of trade concessions"
961,The Company was permitted to rent more lands around Calcutta
962," In Hyderabad, the Company retained its existing privilege of freedom from duties in trade and had to pay the prevailing rent only for Madras"
963," In Surat, for an annual payment of 10,000 rupees, the East India Company was exempted from the levy of all duties"
964, It was decreed that the coins of the Company minted at Bombay were to have currency throughout the Mughal empire
965,"   Apparently, the English East India Company managed to earn a number of trading concessions in Bengal from the Mughal authority by means of flattery and diplomacy"
966, But the English had to vanquish the French before they could be rid of competitors and establish their complete sway over India
967,"  Merging of Two English Companies After the English revolution of 1688, the Whigs, with their enhanced influence, opposed the monopoly of the East India Company"
968, Thus a rival company was formed which deputed Sir William Norris as its ambassador to the court of Aurangzeb (January 1701April 1702) to gain trading privileges for itself
969," The new company, however, proved a failure"
970," Under pressure from the Crown and the Parliament, the two companies were amalgamated in 1708 under the title of'United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'"
971, This was the East India Companyfrom 1708 to 1873which was to establish British political power in India
972,"  The French Foundation of French Centres in India Although the French harboured a wish to engage in the commerce of the East since the opening years of the sixteenth century, their appearance on the Indian coasts was late"
973," Indeed, the French were the last Europeans to come to India with the purpose of trade"
974," During the reign of Louis XIV, the king's famous minister Colbert laid the foundation of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales (French East India Company) in 1664, in which the king also took a deep interest"
975, The Compagnie des Indes Orientales was granted a 50year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans
976," The French king also granted the company a concession in perpetuity for the island of Madagascar, as well as any        Advent of the Europeans in India  47  other territories it could conquer"
977, The Company spent a lot of its money and resources in trying to revive the colonies of Madagascar but without any success
978," Then in 1667, Francois Caron headed an expedition to India, setting up a factory in Surat"
979," Mercara, a Persian who accompanied Caron, founded another French factory in Masulipatnam in 1669 after obtaining a patent from the Sultan of Golconda"
980," In 1673, the French obtained permission from Shaista Khan, the Mughal Subahdar of Bengal, to establish a township at Chandernagore near Calcutta"
981,"  PondicherryNerve Centre of French Power in India In 1673, Sher Khan Lodi, the governor of Valikondapuram (under the Bijapur Sultan), granted Francois Martin, the director of the Masulipatnam factory, a site for a settlement"
982, Pondicherry was founded in 1674
983," In the same year, Francois Martin replaced Caron as the French governor"
984," The French company established its factories in other parts of India also, particularly in the coastal regions"
985," Mahe, Karaikal, Balasore and Qasim Bazar were a few important trading centres of the French East India Company"
986," After taking charge of Pondicherry in 1674, Francois Martin developed it as a place of importance"
987," It was indeed, the stronghold of the French in India"
988,  Early Setbacks to the French East India Company The French position in India was badly affected with the outbreak of war between the Dutch and the French
989," Bolstered by their alliance with the English since the Revolution of 1688, the Dutch captured Pondicherry in 1693"
990," Although the Treaty of Ryswick concluded in September 1697 restored Pondicherry to the French, the Dutch garrison held on to it for two more years"
991," Once again, under Francois Martin's able guidance Pondicherry flourished and turned out to be the most important settlement of the French in India"
992, Again there  was a bad turn in the fortunes of the French company in India when the War of Spanish Succession broke out in Europe
993," Consequent to this, they had to abandon their factories at Surat, Masulipatnam and Bantam in the early 18th century"
994," The French in India had another setback when Francois Martin died on December 31, 1706"
995,"  Reorganisation of the French Company In 1720, the French company was reorganised as the'Perpetual Company of the Indies' which revived its strength"
996," This was further enhanced by the stewardship of two active and wise governors, Lenoir and Dumas, between 1720 and 1742"
997," Further, the French India was backed by the French possession of Mauritius and Reunion in the southern Indian Ocean"
998,"  The AngloFrench Struggle for Supremacy: the Carnatic Wars Background of Rivalry Though the British and the French came to India for trading purposes, they were ultimately drawn into the politics of India"
999, Both had visions of establishing political power over the region
1000, The AngloFrench rivalry in India reflected the traditional rivalry of England and France throughout their histories
1001, it began with the outbreak of the Austrian War of Succession and ended with the conclusion of the Seven Years War
1002," Specifically in India, the rivalry, in the form of three Carnatic wars, decided once for all that the English and not the French were to become masters of India"
1003," In 1740, the political situation in south India was uncertain and confused"
1004, Nizam Asaf Jah of Hyderabad was old and fully engaged in battling the Marathas in the western Deccan while his subordinates were speculating upon the consequences of his death
1005, To the south of his kingdom lay the Coromandel coast without any strong ruler to maintain a balance of power
1006," Instead, there was the remnant of the old Vijayanagara empire in interior Mysore, Cochin and      Advent of the Europeans in India    49  Travancore in the Malabar coast, and on the east the small states of Madura (Madurai), Tanjore (Thanjavur) and Trichinopoly (Thiruchirapally)"
1007, The decline of Hyderabad was the signal for the end of Muslim expansionism and the English adventurers got their plans ready
1008," Also, there was the Maratha kingdom of Tanjore, providing the Peshwa of Pune an excuse for interference whenever he pleased"
1009,  First Carnatic War (174048) Background Carnatic was the name given by the Europeans to the Coromandel coast and its hinterland
1010, The First Carnatic War was an extension of the AngloFrench War in Europe which was caused by the Austrian War of Succession
1011," Immediate Cause Although France, conscious of its relatively weaker position in India, did not favour an extension of hostilities to India, the English navy under Barnet seized some French ships to provoke France"
1012," France retaliated by seizing Madras in 1746 with the help of the fleet from Mauritius, the Isle of France, under Admiral La Bourdonnais, the French governor of Mauritius"
1013, Thus began the first Carnatic War
1014, Result The First Carnatic War ended in 1748 when the Treaty of AixLa Chapelle was signed bringing the Austrian War of Succession to a conclusion
1015," Under the terms of this treaty, Madras was handed back to the English, and the French, in turn, got their territories in North America"
1016, Significance The First Carnatic War is remembered for the Battle of St
1017," Thome (in Madras) fought between the French forces and the forces of Anwaruddin, the Nawab of Carnatic, to whom the English appealed for help"
1018, A small French army under Captain Paradise defeated the strong Indian army under Mahfuz Khan at St
1019, Thome on the banks of the River Adyar
1020, This was an eyeopener for the Europeans in India: it revealed that even a small disciplined army could easily defeat a much larger Indian army
1021," Further, this war adequately brought out the importance of naval force in the AngloFrench conflict in the Deccan"
1022,The background for the Second Carnatic War was provided by rivalry in India
1023," Dupleix, the French governor who had successfully led the French forces in the First Carnatic War, sought to increase his power and French political influence in southern India by interfering in local dynastic disputes to defeat the English"
1024," Immediate Cause The opportunity was provided by the death of NizamulMulk, the founder of the independent kingdom of Hyderabad, in 1748, and the release of Chanda Sahib, the soninlaw of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, by the Marathas in the same year"
1025," The accession of Nasir Jang, the son of the Nizam, to the throne of Hyderabad was opposed by Muzaffar Jang, the grandson of the Nawab, who laid claim to the throne saying that the Mughal Emperor had appointed him as the governor of the Carnatic"
1026," In the Carnatic, the appointment of Anwaruddin Khan as the Nawab was resented by Chanda Sahib"
1027," The French supported the claims of Muzaffar Jang and Chanda Sahib in the Deccan and Carnatic, respectively, while the English sided with Nasir Jang and Anwaruddin"
1028," Course of the War The combined armies of Muzaffar Jang, Chanda Sahib and the French defeated and killed Anwaruddin at the Battle of Ambur (near Vellore) in 1749"
1029," Muzaffar Jang became the subahdar of Deccan, and Dupleix was appointed governor of all the Mughal territories to the south of the River Krishna"
1030, A French army under Bussy was stationed at Hyderabad to secure French interests there
1031, Territories near Pondicherry and also some areas on the Orissa Coast (including Masulipatnam) were ceded to the French
1032," Having failed to provide effective assistance to Muhammad Ali at Trichinopoly, Robert Clive, then an agent in India Joseph Francis Dupleix, born in 1697, was the son of a wealthy FarmerGeneral of Taxes and DirectorGeneral of the Company of the Indies"
1033," He got a high post at Pondicherry in 1720, allegedly on the basis of influence of his father"
1034," At Pondicherry he made a lot of money by private trade, which was then permitted to servants of the French company"
1035," In December 1726, he was suspended owing to drastic change in the constitution of the French company and some confusions arising out of that"
1036," In 1730, Dupleix won his case, and was appointed as governor of Chandernagore as compensation"
1037," In 1741, he was appointed as the DirectorGeneral of French colonies in India"
1038," Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the Subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang"
1039," According to historians, Dupleix possessed qualities of an administrator, a diplomat, and a leader besides having political insight with a broad vision"
1040," Dupleix in the Role of Administrator In 1741, Dupleix became the GovernorGeneral of Pondicherry"
1041," He found Pondicherry facing several problemsMaratha invasion, famine, uncultivated land and chaotic conditions in the Carnatic"
1042," Apart from these, the Directors of the Company, sought a drastic cut in expenditure of the French East India Company, owing to the priority given to the French colonies in North America"
1043," So, Dupleix reduced public expenditure, despite opposition of his council, and balanced income and expenditure, coupled with a cut on salaries of officers"
1044," However, he decided to disobey the directors on the matter of fortification of settlements"
1045," He enhanced the defences of Pondicherry, even spending a large sum from his personal wealth"
1046, He made Pondicherry the emporium of commerce in south India by taking practical steps to develop the trade of the colony
1047," Later, the Directors of the Company praised Dupleix for taking the right decisions, even in contradiction of the directors"
1048, Dupleix as a Master of Diplomacy The analysis of the first two Carnatic wars proves the diplomacy of Dupleix as a leader who visualised the path of the European conquest of India
1049, Dupleix used the Nawab of Carnatic to forbid the English from    52      A Brief History of Modern India  waging war in his territories so that the French settlements at Pondicherry could be protected till the French forces acquired enough strength
1050, In return the nawab was promised Madras after the English got defeated
1051," But Dupleix, using his diplomacy, didn't give Madras to the nawab and even defeated him at St Thome"
1052," Dupleix convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises made to the English, citing examples from history that promises made under certain circumstances were never binding"
1053," Further, he said that since the position of the governorgeneral was superior to that of the commander of navy, the compact entered into between the latter and the English was ultra vires"
1054," Thus, he was able to convince his subordinate to do what was considered unethical in general terms, but best suited for one's nation"
1055, Dupleix was the first European to interfere in the internal politics of the Indian rulers
1056," He supported Muzzaffar Jang for Hyderabad and Chanda Sahib for Carnatic and his candidates emerged successful and, in return, gave great concessions to Dupleix"
1057," Dupleix was, in fact, the originator of the practice of subsidiary alliance in India"
1058, He placed a French army at Hyderabad at the expense of the subahdar
1059, Why Dupleix Failed in India Dupleix was recalled in 1754 due to the initial defeat of the French army in the Second Carnatic War and the heavy cost incurred by the company due to Dupleix's political decisions
1060, Many historians have called the recall of Dupleix by the directors as a blundera result of a compromise between France and England over issues in America
1061," however, there were some weaknesses in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows: (i) Dupleix suffered from an oversanguine temperament"
1062," He hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical situations"
1063, The peers of Dupleix didn't like his autocratic behaviour and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter
1064,"  Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive"
1065, The French failed to capture Trichnopoly (175253) because the schemes thought out by Dupleix could not be turned into action by his commanders
1066," He suggested a sudden raid on Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, so as to relieve the pressure on Trichinopoly"
1067, He reasoned that in such an event Chanda Sahib would rush to save his capital
1068," Thus, in August 1751, with only a force of 210 men Robert Clive attacked and captured Arcot"
1069," As expected, Chanda Sahib hastened to his capital, taking a force of 4,000 men from Trichinopoly, but failed to get back the fort even after a siege of 53 days, from September 23 to November 14"
1070," Now Mysore, Tanjore and the Maratha chief, Morari Rao, came to the aid of Trichinopoly, and of Clive and Stringer Lawrence"
1071," Trichinopoly was first relieved of its siege, while General Law of France with Chanda Sahib remained cooped up in the island of Srirangam"
1072," They were forced to surrender in June 1752 when Muhammad Ali executed Chanda Sahib, the British failing to interfere"
1073," Views The struggle between Dupleix and Clive in India, the defence of Arcot and the deeds which led to the founding of our Indian Empireâ€¦ all these events were part of a desperate struggle for supremacy between England and France"
1074," Seeley We may regard Dupleix as the most striking figure in the short Indian episode of that long and arduous contest for transmarine dominion which was fought out between France and England in the eighteenth century, although it was far beyond his power to influence the ultimate destiny of either nation in India, and although the result of his plans was that'we accomplished for ourselves against the French exactly everything that the French intended to accomplish for themselves against us' (Clive)"
1075," It is certain, moreover, that the conception of an Indian Empire had already been formed by others besides Dupleix, and that more than one clearheaded observer had perceived how easily the whole country might be subdued by an European power"
1076," Alfred Lyall, annoyed at the heavy financial losses that Dupleix's policy involved, decided to recall him in 1754"
1077, Godeheu succeeded Dupleix as the French GovernorGeneral in India
1078, Godeheu adopted a policy of negotiations with the English and concluded a treaty with them
1079, The English and the French agreed not to interfere in the quarrels of native princes
1080," Also, each party was left in possession of the territories actually occupied by them at the time of the treaty"
1081," According to historians, the fear of serious repercussions in America prompted the French to suspend hostilities in India"
1082, Implications It became evident that the countenance of Indian authority was no longer necessary for European success
1083, rather Indian authority itself was becoming dependent on European support
1084, Muhammad Ali in the Carnatic and Salabat Jang in Hyderabad became clients rather than patrons
1085,"  Third Carnatic War (175863) Background In Europe, when Austria wanted to recover Silesia in 1756, the Seven Years War (175663) started"
1086, Britain and France were once again on opposite sides
1087," Course of War in India In 1758, the French army under Count de Lally captured the English forts of St"
1088, David and Vizianagaram in 1758
1089," Now, the English became offensive and inflicted heavy losses on the French fleet under Admiral D'Ache at Masulipatnam"
1090," Battle of Wandiwash The decisive battle of the Third Carnatic War was won by the English on January 22, 1760 at Wandiwash (or Vandavasi) in Tamil Nadu"
1091, General Eyre Coote of the English totally routed the French army under Count Thomas Arthur de Lally and took Bussy as prisoner
1092," Pondicherry was gallantly defended by Lally for eight months before he surrendered on January 16, 1761"
1093," With the loss of Jinji and Mahe, the French power in India was reduced to its lowest"
1094," Lally, after being taken as prisoner of war at London, returned to France where he was imprisoned and executed in 1766"
1095," Result and Significance The Third Carnatic War      Advent of the Europeans in India    55  View While the English received supplies of food and money from Bengal, recruits of men from Europe, and grain from their northern settlements, the French could receive nothing but what came to them laboriously by land"
1096," The first were constantly strengthened, the second was constantly weakened"
1097, And this enabled Coote to establish his military superiority over Lally in the field and to hem him within the walls of Pondicherry
1098, H
1099,H
1100," Dodwell (The Cambridge History of India, Vol V)  proved decisive"
1101," Although the Treaty of Peace of Paris (1763) restored to the French their factories in India, the French political influence disappeared after the war"
1102," Thereafter, the French, like their Portuguese and Dutch counterparts in India, confined themselves to their small enclaves and to commerce"
1103," The English became the supreme European power in the Indian subcontinent, since the Dutch had already been defeated in the Battle of Bidara in 1759"
1104," The Battle of Plassey, in 1757, is usually regarded by historians as the decisive event that brought about ultimate British rule over India"
1105," However, one cannot quite ignore the view that the true turning point for control of the subcontinent was the victory of British forces over the French forces at Wandiwash in 1760"
1106, The victory at Wandiwash left the English East India Company with no European rival in India
1107, Thus they were ready to take over the rule of the entire country
1108," Significantly, in the Battle of Wandiwash, natives served in both the armies as sepoys"
1109," It makes one think: irrespective of which side won, there was an inevitability about the fall of India to European invaders"
1110, There was a lack of sensitivity to geopolitics of the day as well as a lack of foresight on the part of native rulers
1111,  Causes for the English Success and the French Failure The English company was a private enterprisethis created a sense of enthusiasm and selfconfidence among the people
1112,  About the Goods in Trade Initially There are accounts by various European travellers and traders about the activities in port towns such as Surat which give details of the intricate steps that went into the creation of fabrics collectively called'Indian'
1113," Great demand was there for cotton longcloth, (usually 35 to 50 m in length), salempores (staple cotton cloth), and morees (superior quality cotton cloth)"
1114," Other much desired fabrics were the painted cloths and prints, the silks and dyes"
1115, These textiles were not just in demand in Europe but also in other parts of Asia
1116, Indians had traded in textiles for centuries before the Europeans arrived
1117," In China, Japan and the Indonesian archipelago, Indian cotton was popular for its lightweight, yet strong qualities"
1118," When the Dutch, English and French acquired materials from India, it was not only for their home countries, but for transport to Malacca or Java, for example, where they were traded for spices"
1119," By the 18th century, the French had coloured patterned handkerchiefs specially woven for particular island markets  which proved a successful entrepreneurial effort"
1120, A corollary to the trade in textiles and spices was the trade in slaves
1121," It is generally considered that slave trade concerned Europe, Africa, and the Americas (the'New World'), but this ignores the fact that trade between Europe and Asia also helped to sustain slavery"
1122," French ships took European goods to Asia, where they acquired cowry shells and Indian textiles that were highly valued in West Africa"
1123," Traders exchanged these goods in Africa for slaves, who were sent to the colonies of France in the Americas"
1124," 'The circle was completed,' says the Yale Center for the Study of Globalisation, 'when sugar and other goods from the Americas were loaded on board and shipped back to France"
1125," When the French East India Company started trading in India, they entered an already well established, complex economic system, an intricate network of production, negotiation, delivery, and distribution"
1126, Large commercial fleets as well as prosperous shorebased businesses were run by Indian merchants
1127," Weavers and merchants worked with overland freight operators and brokers, who worked with exporters and ship owners"
1128, These agents had also to negotiate with local state officials for commercial privileges
1129, The European traders had to learn well established rules and practices and successfully collaborate with indigenous envoys
1130,The factories of all the European trading groups were to be found in practically at the same places
1131," At the peak of the Indian trade, the demand for Indian goods exceeded the supply by weavers and other artisans"
1132," But as the three companiesthe Dutch, the English and the Frenchgrew more competitive, the English, better funded and better conversant in local business practices and customs, were able to expand their factory outposts to larger industrial towns under their jurisdiction"
1133," Gradually, these commercial strongholds turned into political enclaves, ultimately enabling the English to expand and consolidate their power and control all over India"
1134,"  With less governmental control over it, this company could take instant decisions when needed without waiting for the approval of the government"
1135," The French company, on the other hand, was a State concern"
1136, It was controlled and regulated by the French government and was hemmed in by government policies and delays in decisionmaking
1137, The English navy was superior to the French navy
1138, it helped to cut off the vital sea link between the French possessions in India and France
1139," The English held three important places, namely, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras whereas the French had only Pondicherry"
1140," The French subordinated their commercial interest to territorial ambition, which made the French company short of funds"
1141," In spite of their imperialistic motives, the British never neglected their commercial interests"
1142, So they always had the funds and the consequent sound financial condition to help them significantly in the wars against their rivals
1143, A major factor in the success of the English in India was the superiority of the commanders in the British camp
1144," In comparison to the long list of leaders on the English side Sir Eyre Coote, Major Stringer Lawrence, Robert Clive and many othersthere was only Dupleix on the French side"
1145,"    The Danes The Danish East India Company was established in 1616 and, in 1620, they founded a factory at Tranquebar near Tanjore, on the eastern coast of India"
1146, Their principal settlement was at Serampore near Calcutta
1147," The Danish factories, which were not important at any time, were sold to the British government in 1845"
1148, The Danes are better known for their missionary activities than for commerce
1149,"  Why the English Succeeded against Other European Powers Of all the European nations who came as traders to India after new sea routes were discovered, England emerged as the most powerful and successful by the end of the eighteenth century"
1150," The major factors which can be attributed for the success of the English against other European powers Portugal, the Netherlands, France and Denmarkin the world in general and in India in particular were as follows:  Structure and Nature of the Trading Companies The English East India Company, formed through amalgamation of several rival companies at home, was controlled by a board of directors whose members were elected annually"
1151," The shareholders of the company exercised considerable influence, as the votes could be bought and sold through purchase of shares"
1152, The trading companies of France and Portugal were largely owned by the State and their nature was in many ways feudalistic
1153," In the French company, the monarch had more than 60 per cent share and, its directors were nominated by the monarch from the shareholders who were supposed to carry on the decisions of two high commissioners appointed by      Advent of the Europeans in India    59  the government"
1154," The shareholders took very little interest in promoting the prosperity of the company, because the State guaranteed a dividend to the shareholders"
1155," The lack of public interest could be inferred from the fact that between 1725 and 1765, there was no meeting of the shareholders and the company was simply managed as a department of the State"
1156,  Naval Superiority The Royal Navy of Britain was not only the largest
1157, it was most advanced of its times
1158, The victory against the Spanish Armada and against the French at Trafalgar had put the Royal Navy at the peak of the European naval forces
1159," In India too, the British were able to defeat the Portuguese and the French due to strong and fast movement of the naval ships"
1160, The English learnt from the Portuguese the importance of an efficient navy and improved their own fleet technologically
1161,"  Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution started in England in the early 18th century, with the invention of new machines like the spinning Jenny, steam engine, the power loom and several others"
1162," These machines greatly improved production in the fields of textile, metallurgy, steam power and agriculture"
1163, The industrial revolution reached other European nations late and this helped England to maintain its hegemony
1164,  Military Skill and Discipline The British soldiers were a disciplined lot and well trained
1165, The British commanders were strategists who tried new tactics in warfare
1166, Technological developments equipped the military well
1167, All this combined to enable smaller groups of English fighters defeat larger armies
1168,"  Stable Government With the exception of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Britain witnessed stable government with efficient monarchs"
1169,Other European nations like France witnessed violent revolution in 1789 and afterwards the Napoleonic Wars
1170," Napoleon's defeat in 1815, significantly weakened France's position and from then on it was forced to side with Britain"
1171, The Italians were united as a nation as late in 1861
1172, The Dutch and Spain were also involved in the 80years war in the 17th century which weakened Portuguese imperialism
1173," The Dutch East India Company, affected by bankruptcy in 1800 coupled with the revolution in 1830, was forced to sell its possessions to Britain and quit Asia"
1174,"  Lesser Zeal for Religion Britain was less zealous about religion and less interested in spreading Christianity, as compared to Spain, Portugal or Dutch"
1175," Thus, its rule was far more acceptable to the subjects than that of other colonial powers"
1176,"  Use of Debt Market One of the major and innovative reasons why Britain succeeded between the mideighteenth century and the midnineteenth century, while other European nations fell, was that it used the debt markets to fund its wars"
1177, The world's first central bankthe Bank of Englandwas established to sell government debt to the money markets on the promise of a decent return on Britain's defeating rival countries like France and Spain
1178, Britain was thus enabled to spend much more on its military than its rivals
1179, Britain's rival France could not match the expenditure of the English
1180," between 1694 and 1812, first under the monarchs, then under the revolutionary governments and finally under Napoleon Bonaparte, France simply went bankrupt with its outdated ways of raising money"

1233, The reign of Aurangzeb (16581707) proved to signify the beginning of the end of Mughal rule in India
1234, It is argued that Aurangzeb's misguided policies weakened the stability of the state and the decline gained momentum after his death due to wars of succession and weak rulers
1235," Though Muhammad Shah ruled for a long spell of 29 years (171948), a revival of the imperial fortunes did not take place as he was an incompetent ruler"

1238,"  Challenges before the Mughals External Challenges In the absence of internal strength, the Mughals could not put a tough front against external challenges which came in the form of several invasions from the northwest"
1239, The northwestern borders had been neglected by the later Mughals and not much effort was expended in protecting the border
1240,"India on the Eve of British Conquest  View Nader Shah was Mughal emperor for only fiftyseven days, in 1739, but those days created aftershocks that transformed India's politics"
1241," They broke existing centres of authority, massively shrinking the scope of Mughal power"
1242, They set loose bands of mounted warriors who ransacked the countryside seeking wealth from villages and towns
1243, They pushed traders behind the walls of whichever power had the strongest forts
1244," For a short period plunder, rather than negotiation, became the most effective tool for creating new centres of wealth"

Panipat and its adjacent region, located in present Haryana on the banks of the Yamuna and between the fertile plains of the Ganga and Indus rivers, have witnessed several battles"

1262, It decided in favour of the continuation of the Mughal rule
1263,The Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali put an end to the Maratha ambition of ruling over India
1264, Why Panipat was a favourite battle field  Panipat had a strategic location
1265," One of the parties of the war generally came from the north/northwest through the Khyber Pass to get hold over Delhi, the political capital of northern India"
1266, To move a military through rough terrainsdeserts of Rajasthan or the other northern areas infested with dense forestswas very risky and difficult
1267," On the other hand, the rulers at Delhi considered Panipat as a confrontable strategic ground and hence they preferred to take the fight there"
1268," Its proximity to Delhi made it easier for the Indian rulers to transport weapons, military and food supplies etc"
1269, Panipat's surrounding region has a flat ground which was suitable for cavalry movementthe main mode of warfare at the time
1270,"  After the construction of the Grand Trunk Road by Sher Shah Suri (154045), Panipat was on this route"
1271, It became easier for conquerors to find their way there
1272,  The duration of monsoon rainfall in the region is short in comparison to other areas making it easier to fight
1273,  The artisans/smiths of these regions were experts in making warfarerelated materials and hence it became easier for forces of both parties to replenish their war materials

1321," In legal terms, the Mughal Empire came to an end on November 1, 1858 with the declaration of Queen Victoria"
1322,  Causes of Decline of Mughal Empire Why the Mughal Empire declined has been a subject of debate among historians
1323, Scholarly opinion can be divided along two broad linesthose who view the matter as generally empirerelated and those who regard the developments as regionrelated
1324, The empirerelated or Mughalcentric view sees the causes of the decline within the structure and functioning of the empire itself
1325, The regionrelated view finds the causes of Mughal decline in the turmoil and instability in the different parts of the empire
1326, The decline was due to both aspects
1327," The process of disintegration of the Mughal Empire began during the reign of Aurangzeb, but it picked up momentum only after his death in 1707"
1328," At his death, conditions were not such that the process of decline could  not be checked"
1329," Although Mughal authority was challenged by several chiefs and rulers, none could assert independence in the face of the imperial might"
1330," The Sikhs, Marathas and Rajputs did not possess the capacity to overthrow the empire"
1331, they merely resisted Mughal power to gain and keep their independence in their respective territories
1332," Thus, if the successors of Aurangzeb had been capable rulers, the empire might not have fallen"
1333," Most of the emperors who came after Aurangzeb proved to be incapable, weak and licentious monarchs who hastened the process of disintegration of the empire and, finally, its collapse"
1334, The major factors which contributed to the downfall of the Mughal Empire are discussed below
1335,  Shifting Allegiance of Zamindars Two classes shared the power of the State with the emperor during the medieval periodthe zamindars and the nobles
1336," The zamindars were hereditary owners of their lands who enjoyed certain privileges on hereditary basis, and were variously known as rais, rajas, thakurs, khuts or deshmukhs"
1337," They occupied an important place in the empire because they helped in the collection of revenue and in local administration, for which they maintained soldiers"
1338," Though the Mughals had tried to curb the power of the zamindars and maintain direct contact with the peasants, they had not wholly succeeded"
1339," During the reign of Aurangzeb itself, there was a marked increase in the power and influence of the zamindars"
1340, The biggest fallout of this was that regional loyalties were encouraged
1341," Many local zamindars helped the nobility, the other powerful class within the empire, to take advantage of the weakness of the empire and carve out independent kingdoms for themselves"
1342,  Jagirdari Crisis The nobility comprised people who were either assigned large jagirs and mansabs or appointed subahdars of Mughal subas and given the responsibility of maintaining these
1343, To      India on the Eve of British Conquest    71  Views The roots of the disintegration of the Mughal empire may be found in the Medieval Indian economy
1344," the stagnation of trade, industry and scientific development within the limits of that economy"
1345, the growing financial crisis which took the form of a crisis of the jagirdari system and affected every branch of state activity
1346, the inability of the nobility to realise in the circumstances their ambitions in the service of the state and consequently the struggle of factions and the bid of ambitious nobles for independent dominion
1347," the inability of the Mughal emperors to accommodate the Marathas and to adjust their claims within the framework of the Mughal empire, and the consequent breakdown of the attempt to create a composite ruling class in India"
1348," and the impact of all these developments on politics at the court and in the country, and upon the security of the northwestern passes"
1349," Individual failings and faults of character also played their due role but they have necessarily to be seen against the background of these deeper, more impersonal factors"
1350," Satish Chandra, Parties and Politics at the Mughal Court, 170740 Various explanations are put forward for the revolts which brought about the collapse of the Mughal Empire"
1351, Here our main concern is with what our 17th and early 18th century authorities have to say
1352," And it will be seen that they, at any rate, put the greatest store by the economic and administrative causes of the upheaval and know little of religious reaction or national consciousness"
1353, Thus was the Mughal Empire destroyed
1354," No new order was, or could be, created by the forces ranged against it"
1355," Irfan Habib, The Agrarian System of Mughal India The more I study the period, the more I am convinced that military inefficiency was the principal, if not the sole, cause of that empire's final collapse"
1356, All other defects and weaknesses were as nothing in comparison with this
1357,"Long before it disappeared, it had lost all military energy at the centre, and was ready to crumble to pieces at the first touch"
1358," The rude hand of no Persian or Afghan conqueror, no Nadir, no Ahmad Abdali, the genius of no European adventure, a Dupleix or a    72      A Brief History of Modern India  Clive, was needed to precipitate it into the abyss"
1359, The empire of the Mughals was already doomed before any of these had appeared on the scene
1360, and had they never been heard of there can be little doubt that some Mahratta bandit or Sikh freebooter would in due time have seated himself on the throne of Akbar and Shahjahan
1361," William Irvine, Army of the Indian Mughals A common impression is, that"
1362,"it was irretrievably ruined in the reign of Aurangzeb, a monarch of great ability, energy and determination, but lacking in political insight, and a bigoted Mussulman"
1363," He struck the first mortal blow by reversing Akbar's wise and generous policy of ignoring distinctions of race and religion, and reimposing the jizya or poll tax, on his Hindu subjects"
1364," whereby he estranged them, and turned the noblest and most warlike of themthe Rajputs, hitherto the staunchest supporters of the throneinto deadly and persistent enemies"
1365," And Shivaji and his followers not only vindicated their independence, but struck a second mortal blow at the integrity of the Empire"
1366, They destroyed its military reputation
1367, They exhausted its accumulated treasure
1368, They spread disorder and devastation over the Deccan and beyond it
1369,They established an imperium in imperio
1370," Thus the Empire, though not dissolved, was hopelessly debilitated"
1371, The effective authority of the central government was thenceforth in abeyance
1372,"Nadir Shah, after inflicting the extremity of humiliation on the Emperor and his capital, annexed the Imperial territory west of the Indus"
1373, The dissolution of the Empire was complete
1374," Sidney Owen, The Fall of the Mughal Empire The Mughal Empire and with it the Maratha overlordship of Hindustan fell because of the rottenness at the core of Indian society"
1375, The rottenness showed itself in the form of military and political helplessness
1376, The country could not defend itself
1377, royalty was hopelessly depraved or imbecile
1378, the nobles were selfish and shortsighted
1379," In the midst of this decay and confusion, our literature, art and even true religion had perished"
1380," Mughal rule has often been defined as 'the rule of the nobility', because these nobles played a central role in administering the empire"
1381," Although Akbar had provided a wellknit organisation for them, there was divisiveness among the nobility on the basis of religion, homeland and tribe, and each category formed a group of its own"
1382," Mutual rivalry, jealousy and contest for power among the various groups during the rule of the later Mughals (in the absence of a strong central leadership) not only reduced the prestige of the emperor, but also contributed to the decline of the empire"
1383,"  Rise of Regional Aspirations Aurangzeb's reign itself witnessed powerful regional groups like the Jats, Sikhs and Marathas defying the authority of the Mughal state in their bid to create kingdoms of their own"
1384," They did not succeed in their efforts, but they influenced the future course of political events in their respective regions"
1385, Their continuous struggle against the empire for political ascendancy weakened the empire considerably
1386," Aurangzeb, and after him Bahadur Shah I, by attempting to suppress the Rajputs, spurred them to battle against the Mughals"
1387," The later Mughals made an effort to follow a policy of reconciliation with the Rajputs, but by then it was already too late: the Rajputs no longer trusted the Mughals enough to ally with them for the welfare of the empire"
1388, The Marathas too were becoming a formidable enemy
1389, Their aim was at first limited only to regaining control over the region of Maharashtra
1390, but it soon went on to include getting legal sanction from the Mughal emperor for collecting sardeshmukhi and chauth throughout India
1391," They forged northwards and, by 1740, succeeded in spreading their influence over the provinces of Gujarat, Malwa and Bundelkhand"
1392," The Rajput struggle against the empire and the growing ambition and power of the Marathas, thus, adversely affected the Mughal might"
1393," Causes of the Mughals' Downfall in a Nutshell Some of the main causes for the decline of the Mughals, briefly put, were as follows: (i) The government of the Mughals was a personal despotism and so its success depended on the character of the reigning ruler"
1394, The later Mughals were worthless and neglected the administration of the state
1395," With the absence of a definite law of succession, there always occurred a war of succession"
1396," this weakened the stability of the government, and fostered partisanship at the cost of patriotism"
1397," The degeneration of the rulers led to the degeneration of the nobility, with factious quarrels and intrigues costing the empire heavily"
1398, The deterioration of the army also proved disastrous for the empire
1399,"The empire had become too vast and unwieldy to be efficiently governed from a central authority under weak rulers, especially under the existing conditions of transport and communication"
1400,"Aurangzeb's religious policy was largely responsible, leading to revolts by Rajputs, Sikhs, Jats and Marathas"
1401, Aurangzeb's Deccan policy was a complete failure and was an important cause of the downfall of the Mughal empire
1402,Invasions of Irani and Durrani kingdoms gave a deathblow to the Mughal empire
1403,  Economic and Administrative Problems The number of amirs and their ranks or mansabs had increased sharply over time
1404, there was little land left to be distributed among them as jagirs
1405, Aurangzeb tried to solve the problem of acute shortage of jagirs or bejagiri by showing enhanced income from the jagirs on record
1406, But this was a shortsighted measure as the amirs tried to recover the recorded income from their jagirs by pressurising the peasantry
1407, So both the amirs and the peasantry were antagonised
1408," Then there were the wars, the luxurious lifestyles of the emperors and amirs alike, the reduction in khalisa land, all of which burdened the state"
1409, The result was that the expenditure of the state much exceeded its income
1410,"There was, moreover, no significant scientific and technological advance that could have improved a stagnant economy"
1411, The once flourishing trade did not enrich the empire's coffers even as the inroads by European traders grew along coastal India
1412, These economic and administrative problems only multiplied following the death of Aurangzeb
1413, The empire had become too vast to be efficiently administered by a centralised system when the rulers were weak and incompetent
1414,  Rise of Regional States The states that emerged as a result of the decline of the Mughal Empire can be classified into the following three broad categories: (i) Successor States These were the Mughal provinces that turned into states after breaking away from the empire
1415," Though they did not challenge the sovereignty of the Mughal ruler, the establishment of virtually independent and hereditary authority by their governors showed the emergence of autonomous polity in these territories"
1416," Some examples are Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad"
1417,"  Independent Kingdoms These states came into existence primarily due to the destabilisation of the Mughal control over the provinces, examples being Mysore, Kerala and the Rajput states"
1418,"The New States These were the states set up by the rebels against the Mughal empire, examples being the Maratha, the Sikh and the Jat states"
1419,"  Survey of Regional Kingdoms Hyderabad The founder of the AsafJah house of Hyderabad was Kilich Khan, popularly known as NizamulMulk"
1420, It was Zulfikar Khan who had first conceived the idea of an independent state in the Deccan
1421, But with his death in 1713 the dream remained unfulfilled
1422," Kilich Khan, disgusted with the Mughal emperor who had appointed Mubariz Khan as a fullfledged viceroy of the Deccan, decided to fight Mubariz Khan"
1423, He defeated and later killed Mubariz Khan in the Battle of ShakrKheda (1724)
1424, He now assumed control of the Deccan
1425," In 1725, he became the viceroy and conferred on himself the title of AsafJah"
1426,"  Awadh The founder of the independent principality of Awadh was Saadat Khan, popularly known as BurhanulMulk"
1427, Saadat Khan was a Shia
1428," He had joined in a conspiracy against the Sayyid brothers, which resulted in his being given an increased mansab"
1429," Later, driven out of the court, he was prompted to found a new independent state"
1430, Saadat Khan committed suicide due to pressure from Nadir Shah who was demanding a huge booty from him
1431, He was succeeded by Safdar Jang as the Nawab of Awadh
1432,  Bengal Murshid Kuli Khan was the founder of the independent state of Bengal
1433, He was a capable ruler and made Bengal a prosperous state
1434, He was succeeded in 1727 by his son Shujauddin
1435," His successor, Sarfaraz Khan, was killed in 1740 by Alivardi Khan, the deputy governor of Bihar at Gheria, who assumed power and made himself independent of the Mughal emperor by giving yearly tribute"
1436,  The Rajputs The Rajputs tried to reestablish their independence in the 18th century
1437," This forced the Mughal ruler Bahadur Shah I to march against Ajit Singh (1708), who had formed an alliance with Jai Singh II and Durgadas Rathor"
1438, But the alliance was broken and the situation was saved for the Mughals
1439, At one time the Rajputs controlled the entire territory extending from the south of Delhi up to the western coast
1440,Mysore Another important state to make its appearance in the eighteenth century was that of Mysore
1441, This territory located at the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghats was ruled by the Wodeyars
1442," Various powers, interested in this territory, turned the area into a constant battlefield"
1443, In the end the Mysore state was brought under the rule of Haider Ali who ruled the state but not without trouble
1444, He was involved in constant warfare with the British and so was his son Tipu Sultan
1445,  Kerala Martanda Varma established an independent state of Kerala with Travancore as his capital
1446, He extended the boundaries of his state from Kanyakumari to Cochin
1447, He made efforts to organise his army along the Western model and adopted various measures to develop his state
1448,"  The Jats The agriculturist Jat settlers living around Delhi, Mathura, and Agra revolted against the oppressive policies of Aurangzeb"
1449," After some initial setbacks, Churaman and Badan Singh succeeded in setting up the Jat state of Bharatpur"
1450, But it was under Suraj Mal that Jat power reached its zenith
1451, He not only provided an efficient system of administration but also greatly extended the territory of the state
1452," His state included territories from Ganga in the east to Chambal in the south and included the Subahs of Agra, Mathura, Meerut and Aligarh"
1453," However, the Jat state suffered a decline after the death of Suraj Mal in 1763"
1454," Thereafter, the state split into small areas controlled by petty zamindars who mainly lived by plunder"
1455,  The Sikhs Guru Gobind Singh transformed the Sikhs into a militant sect in defence of their religion and liberties
1456," Banda Bahadur, who later assumed the leadership of the Sikhs in 1708, was    78      A Brief History of Modern India  defeated and killed"
1457," In the wake of the invasions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Sikhs once again asserted their authority"
1458, At this stage they organised themselves into 12 misls or confederacies which exercised control over different parts of the kingdom
1459, The credit for establishing a strong kingdom of Punjab goes to Ranjit Singh
1460," He was the son of Mahan Singh, the leader of the Sukarchakiya misl"
1461, Ranjit Singh brought under control the area extending from the Sutlej to the Jhelum
1462, He conquered Lahore in 1799 and Amritsar in 1802
1463," By the Treaty of Amritsar with the British, Ranjit Singh acknowledged the British right over the cisSutlej territories"
1464, Ranjit Singh proved to be an efficient administrator
1465, He greatly modernised his army with the help of Europeans
1466," But towards the close of his reign, the English forced him to sign the Tripartite Treaty in 1838 with Shah Shuja and the English Company whereby he agreed to provide passage to the British troops through Punjab with a view to placing Shah Shuja on the throne of Kabul"
1467, Ranjit Singh died in 1839
1468," His successors could not keep the state intact and, soon enough, the British took control over it"
1469,  The Marathas Perhaps the most formidable province to emerge was that of the Marathas
1470," Under the capable leadership of the Peshwas, the Marathas uprooted the Mughal authority from Malwa and Gujarat and established their rule"
1471," At one time they claimed the right to be the chief inheritors of the Mughal dominion, but their authority was challenged by Ahmed Shah Abdali in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761)"
1472, The Marathas quickly recovered from the defeat and offered the most formidable challenge to the English East India Company in the struggle for political supremacy in India
1473,  Rohilakhand and Farukhabad The states of Rohilakhand and the kingdom of the Bangash Pathans were a fall out of the Afghan migration into India
1474, Large scale immigration of Afghans into India took place in      India on the Eve of British Conquest    79  mid18th century because of political and economic turmoil in Afghanistan
1475," Ali Muhammad Khan took advantage of the collapse of authority in north India following Nadir Shah's invasion, to set up a petty kingdom, Rohilakhand"
1476, This was the area of the Himalayan foothills between Kumaon in the north and the Ganga in the south
1477," The Rohillas, as the inhabitants of Rohilakhand were known, suffered heavily at the hands of the other powers in the area, the Jats and the Awadh rulers and, later, the Marathas and the British"
1478," Mohammad Khan Bangash, an Afghan, set up an independent kingdom to the east of Delhi in the area around Farrukhabad, during the reigns of Farrukhsiyar and Muhammad Shah"
1479,  Nature and Limitations of Regional States The independent political systems that emerged in the provinces continued to maintain ties with the Mughal imperial authority and acknowledged the emperor's importance as an umbrella
1480, Even rebel chieftains of the Marathas and Sikhs recognised the Mughal emperor as the supreme authority
1481," The polity that emerged in these states was regional in character, and functional with the collaborative support of the different local groups like the zamindars, merchants, local nobles and chieftains"
1482, The provincial rulers had to take care of these various local interests in order to maintain themselves
1483," Of course, there were exceptions"
1484," for instance, in Mysore, rulers did not recognise the local chieftains"
1485, The regional states had certain limitations
1486," The provincial rulers failed to develop a system based on sound financial, administrative and military organisation"
1487," Though some of them tried to modernise, notably Mysore, on the whole, they were backward in science and technology"
1488, Another drawback was the constant warfare these states had with the neighbouring regional powerswars in which none could ultimately dominate
1489," In fact, these states were strong enough to challenge Mughal power, but none was able to replace it with a stable polity at an allIndia level"
1490,"The jagirdari crisis intensified as income from agriculture declined, and the number of contenders for a share of the surplus multiplied"
1491," Though trade, internal and foreign, continued without disruption and even prospered, the rest of the economy stagnated"
1492,"  SocioEconomic Conditions Eighteenth century India failed to make progress economically, socially or culturally, at an adequate pace"
1493, India became a land of contrasts because extreme poverty and extreme luxury existed side by side
1494," The common populace remained impoverished, backward and oppressed and lived at the bare subsistence level"
1495, the rich and the powerful enjoyed a life of luxury and lavishness
1496," But it is worth noting that the life of the Indian masses was, by and large, better in the 18th century than it was after 100 years of British rule"
1497,"  Agriculture Though agriculture was technically backward, it was worked by the hard labour of peasants"
1498, But this hard working class seldom got the fruits of their labour
1499," Even though the agricultural produce supported the rest of the society, a peasant's own reward was miserably inadequate"
1500," They were forced to pay exorbitant amounts to the state, the zamindars, the jagirdars, and the revenuefarmers"
1501, But this worsened under British rule
1502,"  Trade and Industry On account of being selfsufficient in handicrafts and agricultural products, India did not import foreign goods on a large scale"
1503," On the other hand, its industrial and agricultural products were in good demand in foreign markets"
1504, Hence its exports were more than its imports
1505, trade was balanced by import of silver and gold
1506, India was known as a sink of precious metals
1507,     Views Bear in mind that the commerce of India is the commerce of the world andâ€¦ he who can exclusively command it is the dictator of Europe
1508, Peter the Great India was a far greater industrial and manufacturing nation than any in Europe or any other in Asia
1509," Her textile goodsthe fine products of her looms, in cotton, wool, linen and silkwere famous over the civilised world"
1510, so were her exquisite jewellery and her precious stones cut in every lovely form
1511," so were her pottery, porcelains, ceramics of every kind, quality, color and beautiful shape"
1512," so were her fine works in metaliron, steel, silver and gold"
1513, She had great architectureequal in beauty to any in the world
1514, She had great engineering works
1515," She had great merchants, great businessmen, great bankers and financiers"
1516," Not only was she the greatest shipbuilding nation, but she had great commerce and trade by land and sea which extended to all known civilised countries"
1517, Such was the India which the British found when they came
1518," Sunderland For centuries the handloom weavers of Bengal had produced some of the world's most desirable fabrics, especially the fine muslins, light as'woven air', that were coveted by European dressmakers"
1519," As late as the mideighteenth century, Bengal's textiles were still being exported to Egypt, Turkey and Persia in the West, and to Java, China and Japan in the East, along wellestablished trade routes, as well as to Europe"
1520," Shashi Tharoor, An Era of Darkness  Items of Import From the Persian Gulf Region pearls, raw silk, wool, dates, dried fruits, and rose water,  from Arabiacoffee, gold, drugs, and honey  from Chinatea, sugar, porcelain, and silk  from Africaivory and drugs  from Europe woollen cloth, copper, iron, lead and paper"
1521," Items of Export Cotton textiles, raw silk and silk fabrics, hardware, indigo, saltpetre, opium, rice, wheat, sugar, pepper and other spices, precious stones, and drugs"
1522,"Important Centres of Textile Industry Dacca, Murshidabad, Patna, Surat, Ahmedabad, Broach, Chanderi, Burhanpur, Jaunpur, Varanasi, Lucknow, Agra, Multan, Lahore, Masulipatnam, Aurangabad, Chicacole, Vishakhapatnam, Bangalore, Coimbatore, Madurai, etc"
1523, Kashmir was a centre of woollen manufactures
1524," Shipbuilding Industry Maharashtra, the Andhra region and Bengal were the leaders in shipbuilding"
1525, Indian shipping also flourished on the Kerala coast at Calicut and Quilon
1526, The Zamorin of Calicut used the Muslim Kunjali Maraikkars (who were well known for their seafaring ability) for his navy
1527, Shivaji Bhonsle's navy put up a good defence on the west coast against the Portuguese
1528," According to Bipan Chandra, the European companies bought many Indianmade ships for their use"
1529,  Status of Education The education imparted in 18thcentury India was still traditional which could not match with the rapid developments in the West
