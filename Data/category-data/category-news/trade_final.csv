118,"It is possible to levy a tariff as a political policy choice, and to consider a theoretical optimum tariff rate"
119,"The tariff has been used as a political tool to establish an independent nation; for example, the United States Tariff Act of 1789, signed specifically on July 4, was called the ""Second Declaration of Independence"" by newspapers because it was intended to be the economic means to achieve the political goal of a sovereign and independent United States"

128,Free trade is based on the theory of comparative advantage

131,"If they are internationally mobile and the most productive use of factors is in another country, then free trade will lead them to migrate to that country"
132,An externality is the term used when the price of a product does not reflect its cost or real economic value
133,"For example, goods from a country with lax pollution standards will be too cheap"
134,"On the positive externalities, if an industry generates technological spinoffs for the rest of the economy, then free trade can let that industry be destroyed by foreign competition because the economy ignores its hidden value"
135,Comparative advantage theory deals with the best use of resources and how to put the economy to its best use
136,"For example, when workers cannot move from one industry to anotherâ€”usually because they do not have the right skills or do not live in the right placeâ€”changes in the economy's comparative advantage will not shift them to a more appropriate industry, but rather to unemployment or precarious and unproductive jobs"
137,"Comparative advantage theory allows for a ""static"" and not a ""dynamic"" analysis of the economy"
138,"According to theory, the only advantage of international trade is that goods become cheaper and available in larger quantities"
139,"However, the world, and in particular the industrialized countries, are characterized by dynamic gains endogenous to trade, such as technological growth that has led to an increase in the standard of living and wealth of the industrialized world"
140,"A crucial assumption in both the classical and neoclassical formulation of comparative advantage theory is that trade is balanced, which means that the value of imports is equal to the value of each country's exports"
141,"So if trade were not balanced in itself and if there were no adjustment mechanism, there would be no reason to achieve a comparative advantage"
142,"Thus, theory can very easily recommend a trade policy that gives us the highest possible standard of living in the short term but none in the long term"
143,The assumption that trade will always be balanced is a corollary of the fact that trade is understood as barter
144,"In practice, however, the velocity  of circulation is not constant and the quantity of money is not neutral for the real economy"
145,"Ricardo and later classical economists assume that labour tends towards full employment and that capital is always fully used in a liberalized economy, because no capital owner will leave its capital unused but will always seek to make a profit from it"
146,"From a theoretical point of view, comparative advantage theory must assume that labour or capital is used to its full potential and that resources limit production"
147,"If a country's resources were not fully utilized, production and consumption could be increased at the national level without participating in international trade"
148,"In practice, however, the world is characterised by unemployment"
