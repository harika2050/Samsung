# Named Entity Recogition and Category classification

## Data

The folder contains two subdirectories
- **category-data**
- **ner-data**

Each of which contains the data that were retrieved and pre-processed and then used for generating our models.

## Source

The folder contains 3 subdirectories
- **Category**
- **NER**
- **Pre-processing**

The **Category** and **NER** directories contain codes in jupyter notebooks, each implementing a different algorithm/model.
*The jupyter notebooks can be run directly accessing the data in the Data folder.*

The **Pre-processing** folder cotains the codes that were used to scrape, retrieve, parse and extract data required to build and train our models.
